# Team Management Solution for sonic-mgmt

This solution addresses the issue "why I do not see 'remove from team' button" by implementing comprehensive team management functionality for the sonic-mgmt repository.

## What Was Added

### 1. Web-based Team Management Interface (`spytest/spytest/team_management.html`)

A user-friendly web interface that provides:
- **Visual team display** with current members
- **Remove from team buttons** (the missing functionality mentioned in the issue)
- **Add member functionality** with input validation
- **Multiple teams support**: Core Development Team, Testing Team, Network Team
- **CODEOWNERS synchronization** capability
- **Real-time notifications** for all actions

### 2. Command-line Team Management Tool (`tools/team_manager.py`)

A Python script that provides:
- **Command-line interface** for team management
- **CODEOWNERS file integration** - automatically loads existing team memberships
- **Safe operations** with backup functionality
- **JSON export** for team data
- **Multiple commands**: add, remove, list, sync, export

### 3. Dashboard Integration

Updated the main SPyTest dashboard (`spytest/spytest/dashboard.html`) to include:
- **Teams menu item** in the navigation
- **Integration** with existing dashboard framework
- **Seamless access** to team management from the main interface

## How to Use

### Web Interface

1. Access the SPyTest dashboard
2. Click on "Teams" in the left navigation menu
3. Use the **red "×" buttons** to remove members from teams (this is the "remove from team" button that was missing)
4. Add new members using the input fields and "Add Member" buttons
5. Sync changes with CODEOWNERS using the "Sync with CODEOWNERS" button

### Command Line

```bash
# List all team members
python3 tools/team_manager.py list

# List specific team
python3 tools/team_manager.py list --team core-team

# Remove member from team
python3 tools/team_manager.py remove testing-team "@username"

# Add member to team  
python3 tools/team_manager.py add network-team "@newuser"

# Sync teams with CODEOWNERS
python3 tools/team_manager.py sync

# Export teams to JSON
python3 tools/team_manager.py export --output teams.json
```

## Features

### Remove from Team Functionality (Main Fix)
- ✅ **Red remove buttons** next to each team member
- ✅ **Confirmation dialogs** to prevent accidental removal
- ✅ **Visual feedback** with animations and notifications
- ✅ **Both web and CLI interfaces** support removal

### Security & Safety
- **Backup creation** before CODEOWNERS modifications
- **Input validation** for usernames and team names
- **Confirmation prompts** for destructive operations
- **Error handling** and user feedback

### Integration
- **CODEOWNERS file parsing** to load existing teams
- **Automatic categorization** based on code paths
- **Dashboard integration** through template system
- **JSON export** for external tool integration

## Technical Implementation

### Team Categories
Teams are automatically populated from CODEOWNERS based on path patterns:
- **Testing Team**: Paths containing 'test', 'azure-pipelines'  
- **Network Team**: Paths containing 'sonic', 'network', 'switching'
- **Core Team**: All other paths and general repository access

## Solution Benefits

1. **Addresses the core issue**: Provides the missing "remove from team" button functionality
