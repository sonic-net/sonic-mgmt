# Objective

This document captures the tests that are intended to be covered in the blackbox test environment for Watchport feature.

# Overview

Watchport is a feature that aims to quickly remove a link (that went down) from the WCMP/ECMP group it participates in before the controller (used interchangeably with the external view) can detect the link down event and take the appropriate recovery action. This is mainly to shorten the duration of traffic black hole problems that may arise if a down member exists in a WCMP/ECMP group.

The test-plan aims to verify the correctness of the feature by picking up certain triggers and common use-cases. The testing will not cover the following:

-   Reference or object dependencies like whether a nexthop member exists before being referenced in the WCMP/ECMP group action.
-   Traffic loss/convergence related scenarios.

# Testbed Requirements

The testbed requirements are the existence of a basic blackbox setup that comprises a SUT and control switch which are connected to each other on multiple links.

# Test Cases

## Configured weights are realized

<li>Create a WCMP/ECMP group (herein referred to as Action Profile Group APG) with multiple members (herein referred to as Action Profile Members APM) with an associated watch port for each member.</li>

<li>Send different packets to the SUT from the control switch by varying a field in the packet header that will apply the hashing algorithm to select an APM from the APG.</li>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Expected Results</strong></td>
      <td><ul>

<ul>
<li>Send different packets as in the earlier step and verify traffic is distributed only to the members whose watch port link is up.</li>
