    # Bazel redacts certain cc macros such as __DATA__ and __TIMESTAMP__
    # since they will cause the compiled code to have timestamps or other
    # similar information in it, causing the compilation to be
    # non-deterministic.
    # Without such redaction, running the compilation twice with no changes in
    # the code will produce seemingly different binaries.
    # Bazel fixes this by setting the value of these macros to "redacted",
    # which is a valid c++ expression through CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS Toolchain
    # options.
    # See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5750
    # However, the quotes get dropped because of some bash serialization in
    # rules_foreign_cc when they are passed (as bash environment variables) to
    # "./configure", causing __DATA__ to resolve to the unquoted token redacted,
    # which is usually not a valid c++ expression.
    # This fixes that, it makes redacted (the token not the string) an alias to
    # 0, which is a valid c++ expression.
    # This is a minor improvement on top of:
    # https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/issues/239
