## Overview
The purpose of these tests is to evaluate various High Availability (HA)
scenarios associated with testing planned and unplanned events in the
SmartSwitch system.

### Scope
These tests are targeted on a fully functioning SmartSwitch system. We will
be measuring the system as a whole while evaluating HA scenarios such as 100%
link loss, DPU, and Grey failover.

### Keysight Testbed
Tests will run on the following testbeds.

![HA TestBed](images/ha_testbed.svg)

Model expanded to show Keysight chassis, SONiC Capable Switch, and
SmartSwitch.  The SONiC Switch and SmartSwitchs can be used to configure
various test case scenarios and network configurations.  For example,
simulating DPUs within the same or separate SmartSwitch or pairing distant
DPUs to form HA sets.  The SONiC Switch shall additionally be used with
Stateful traffic for VxLan encapsulation and decapsulation.

![HA SmartSwitch Topology](images/smartswitch_ha_topology.svg)

## Topology
### Configuration for HA testing
The topic presented is an interim for SmartSwitch HA testing.  The primary
goal is to illustrate a vision for simulating multiple HA scenarios using
a SmartSwitch mock-up to test DPU SmartSwitch behavior.   This document is
based on testing now before full Sonic integration.  We are working on
aligning test cases and setup with the HA test plan.

![HA topology](images/ha_test_topology.svg)

## Setup Configuration
There are three main test configurations used for exercising the various
test configurations. All three use a traffic generator.  Traffic is sent
through a SONiC capable switch and then to a SmartSwitch(s) which hosts a DPU
to be tested.

Configuration1.  In cases of a single DPU, the test will run under one
Smartswitch.  This objective is to baseline performance of the network
traffic with HA enabled.

Configuration2.  A second test configuration will use two DPUs from different
SmartSwitches.  In this case, HA will be enabled.  For example, dpu0 in
SmartSwitch0 will be the Active node and dpu0 in SmartSwitch1 shall be set to
Standby.  Both DPUs will share same network configurations.

## Test Methodology
Following test methodology will be used for measuring HA switchover and
performance.
* Traffic generator will be used to configure ENI peering between DPU ports.
* Data traffic will be sent from  server to server via SmartSwitch, server
to SmartSwitch and SmartSwitch to server.
* Depending on the test case, switchovers/failovers will be generated and
measured.
* Switchover between DPUs will be measured by noting down the precise time of
the switchover/failover event.  Traffic generator will create those
timestamps and provide us with the recovery statistics.


## Test cases

### Common Steps
Configuration1: Single SmartSwitch with Single DPU.
* Configure 1 DPUs networked within a SmartSwitch with HA not enable.
* The SmartSwitch configuration will consist of 1 DPU.
* The SONiC Switch will be configured to route traffic to SmartSwitch0 hosting
DPU.
* There will be a physical link between front panel ports of SONiC switch and
SmartSwitch0.
* Verify links are up and start all protocols and verify traffic is
established.
* Enable csv logging and check the state of the DPU through the API.
* Apply and start traffic stateful and stateless.

Configuration2: Two Smart Switches with Two DPUs.
![HA Perfect Sync Between HA Sets](images/ha_linkloss_test.svg)
* Configure 2 DPUs networked across two SmartSwitches forming an HA set.
* The SmartSwitch configuration will consist of 2 DPUs sharing the same
network configurations such as: IPs, MACs, VLan/VxLan, ENIs.
* The SONiC Switch will be configured to split traffic into two separate
entities.
* There will be a physical link between front panel ports of both
SmartSwitch0 and SmartSwitch1 and SONiC switch.
* For traffic from server (simulating T2), it will be using 1 link to
SmartSwitch NPU.
* For traffic from SmartSwitch NPU to the other NPU, we will use 2 links as
ECMP groups to simulate multi-T0 bounce-back routing.
* Verify links are up and start all protocols and verify traffic is
established.
* Enable csv logging and check the state of the DPUs through the API.
* Apply and start traffic stateful and stateless.

### Test Metrics
Each test case will use the following metrics to measure performance of the HA
failover/switchover for all test cases.

The following metrics shall be collected Before and After switchover is
initiated.

| Performance Metric                  | Achieved |
|:------------------------------------|:--------:|
| Concurrent Connections              |         |
| CPS                                 |         |
| PPS                                 |         |
| TCP Connection Breaks               |         |

As soon as failover/switchover is initiated a timer will be initiated to
measure DPU pair switchover.

| Failover/Switchover<br/>Type |                   Event                    | Convergence (s) |
|:------------------------|:------------------------------------------:| :---: |
|                         | Switchover time from <br/>Active-to-Standby DPU | 0  |

* TODO: Add flow comparison, dump all flows from both DPUs and compare them using
Dash FLow API.
