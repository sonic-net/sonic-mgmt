# System Test Plan For Transceivers

## Overview

The System Test Plan for transceivers outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for overall system functionality, including link behavior in various scenarios such as process and docker restarts, and advanced transceiver features. This document employs an attribute-driven approach to provide flexible, platform-specific testing that covers traditional transceiver operations as well as modern C-CMIS capabilities.

## Scope

The scope of this test plan includes the following:

- Verification of transceiver system-level functionality and performance across various transceiver types
- Validation of link behavior during system disruptions (process restarts, docker restarts, reboots)
- Testing of transceiver subsystem resilience and recovery mechanisms
- Validation of data consistency across transceiver-related components
- Advanced C-CMIS transceiver testing including frequency and tx power adjustment
- SI (Signal Integrity) settings validation for both optics and media configurations
- Stress testing and load validation under various system conditions
- Platform-specific behavior validation and attribute-driven test configuration

## Optics Scope

## CLI Commands Reference

For detailed CLI commands used in the test cases below, please refer to the [CLI Commands section](../transceiver_onboarding_test_plan.md#cli-commands) in the transceiver onboarding test plan. This section provides comprehensive examples of all relevant commands

## Test Cases

**Test Execution Prerequisites:**

The following tests from the [Transceiver Onboarding Test Plan](../transceiver_onboarding_test_plan.md#test-cases) will be run prior to executing the system tests:

- Transceiver presence check
- Ensure active firmware is gold firmware (for non-DAC CMIS transceivers)
- Link up verification
- LLDP verification (if enabled)

**Assumptions for the Below Tests:**

- All the below tests will be executed for all the transceivers connected to the DUT (the port list is derived from the `port_attributes_dict`) unless specified otherwise.

## Test Execution Flow

### Recommended Test Order

The following execution order is recommended to minimize system disruption and ensure reliable test results:

1. **Link Behavior Test Cases** - Basic port operations that establish baseline functionality
2. **Diagnostic Test Cases** - Non-disruptive validation of transceiver capabilities
3. **Transceiver Event Handling Test Cases** - State change validation (requires careful state management)
4. **Process and Service Restart Test Cases** - Medium system disruption tests
5. **System Recovery Test Cases** - High system disruption tests (reboots)
6. **Stress and Load Test Cases** - Extended duration tests (run last to avoid impact on other tests)

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Attribute Usage in Tests

- **Settle Time Attributes**: Used as maximum wait times before declaring test failure
- **Iteration Attributes**: Define the number of test cycles for stress testing
- **Boolean Attributes**: Control conditional test behavior and expectations

### Test State Management

- **State Preservation**: Before each test that modifies transceiver settings (e.g., loopback modes, low power mode, Tx disable), the original state should be captured
- **State Reversion**: After each test completion (pass or fail), the transceiver should be reverted to its original operational state
- **Cleanup on Failure**: If a test fails during execution, cleanup procedures should still attempt to restore the original state to prevent impact on subsequent tests
- **Link Recovery**: After state reversion, tests should verify that links return to their expected operational state before proceeding to the next test

## Common Verification Procedures

The following procedures are referenced throughout the test cases to ensure consistent validation:

### Standard Port Recovery and Verification Procedure

This procedure is used after any test that modifies transceiver state or after system disruptions:

1. **Link Status Verification**
   - Verify port is operationally up
   - Wait for configured timeout period before declaring failure

2. **LLDP Verification** (if `verify_lldp_on_link_up` is True)
   - Verify port appears in LLDP neighbor table
   - Confirm LLDP neighbor information is correctly populated (remote device ID, port ID, etc. if applicable)

3. **CMIS State Verification** (for non-DAC CMIS transceivers (can be checked via `is_non_dac_cmis` attribute))
   - Verify DataPathState is `DPActivated` for operational ports
   - Verify ConfigState is `ConfigSuccess`

4. **SI Settings Verification** (if applicable)
   - **Optics SI Settings**: If `optics_si_settings` is defined, verify current EEPROM values match configured attributes
   - **Media SI Settings**: If `media_si_settings` is defined, verify PORT_TABLE APPL_DB values match configured attributes. Also, ensure `NPU_SI_SETTINGS_SYNC_STATUS_KEY` is set to `NPU_SI_SETTINGS_DONE` in `PORT_TABLE` of `APPL_DB`
   - Log any discrepancies for analysis

5. **Application Code Verification** (if `expected_application_code` is defined and not null)
   - Read current application code from transceiver EEPROM
   - Verify the actual application code matches the `expected_application_code` value
   - Log any discrepancies for analysis

### State Preservation and Restoration

This procedure ensures tests don't interfere with each other:

1. **State Capture** (before test execution)
   - Record current port operational states

2. **State Restoration** (after test completion, regardless of pass/fail)
   - Restore all modified transceiver settings to original values
   - Verify all ports return to their original operational states
   - Execute **Standard Port Recovery and Verification Procedure** for affected ports

In a loop, execute warm reboot for `warm_reboot_iterations` iterations.<br>4. Wait `warm_reboot_settle_sec` after each reboot.<br>5. After each reboot iteration, execute **Standard Port Recovery and Verification Procedure**.<br>6. Execute **State Preservation and Restoration** (restoration phase). | Ensure all ports link up again post-reboot with all comprehensive verification checks passing for all iterations. System should remain stable throughout multiple reboots. |
| 5 | Fast reboot stress test | 1. Skip test if `fast_reboot_supported` is False.<br>2. Execute **State Preservation and Restoration** (capture phase).<br>3. In a loop, execute fast reboot for `fast_reboot_iterations` iterations.<br>4. Wait `fast_reboot_settle_sec` after each reboot.<br>5.

| 6 | Link stability monitoring test | 1. Verify all transceivers are in operational state with links up.<br>2. Record initial `last_up_time` and `flap_count` for each port from interface status.<br>3. Start monitoring for `link_stability_monitor_sec` duration:<br>   a. Continuously check link status every 10 seconds.<br>   b. Log any link state changes (up to down or down to up).<br>4. After monitoring period completion, verify that `last_up_time` and `flap_count` remain unchanged for all ports.<br>5. Execute **Standard Port Recovery and Verification Procedure** for all ports. | All transceivers maintain stable link status throughout the entire monitoring period with no unexpected link flaps. The `last_up_time` and `flap_count` values must remain unchanged, confirming no link instability occurred. This test validates long-term stability under steady-state conditions. |

## Cleanup and Post-Test Verification

After test completion:

### Immediate Cleanup

1. **State Restoration**: Verify all transceivers are restored to their original operational state
2. **Link Status**: Verify all transceivers are in operational state with links up
3. **Configuration Reset**: Ensure any temporary configuration changes (e.g., pmon_daemon_control.json modifications) are reverted
4. **System Health**: Check system logs for any unexpected errors or warnings introduced during testing
5. **Service Status**: Verify all services and daemons are running normally
6. **Database Consistency**: Verify state databases contain expected transceiver information and are consistent

### Post-Test Report Generation

1. **Test Summary**: Generate comprehensive test results including pass/fail status for each test case
2. **Performance Metrics**: Document settle times, iteration counts, and any performance deviations
3. **Error Analysis**: Compile any errors or warnings encountered during testing with recommended remediation
4. **System State**: Document final system state and any persistent configuration changes
