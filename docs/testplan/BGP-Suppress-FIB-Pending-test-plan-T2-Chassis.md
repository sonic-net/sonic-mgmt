## Overview

This test plan is an extension of the __BGP Suppress FIB Pending Test Plan__ added for T1 DUT at [https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/docs/testplan/BGP-Suppress-FIB-Pending-test-plan.md]. 

As of today, SONiC BGP advertises learnt prefixes regardless of whether these prefixes were successfully programmed into ASIC.
While route programming failure is followed by orchagent crash and all services restart, even for successfully created routes there is a short period of time when the peer will be black holing traffic.

### Scope

The test is to verify the mechanism that allows BGP not to advertise routes that haven't been installed into ASIC yet.


### Scale / Performance

No scale/performance test involved in this test plan

### Related **DUT** CLI commands
Command to enable the feature:
```
admin@sonic:~$ sudo config suppress-fib-pending enabled
```
Command to disable the feature:
```
admin@sonic:~$ sudo config suppress-fib-pending disabled
```
Note: Issue raised for the above command not working on multi-asic environment globally, https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/issues/19022 . Currently it works only as specific asic commands.

### Supported Topology
The tests will be supported on t1 as well as on t2 topo.


## Test cases

As part of test changes for T2, to be consistent with existing T1 test cases, we will choose DUT which is connected to downstream T1 neighbors. This is because, on the other line card connected to upstream neighbors, it is not possible to verify traffic not being sent to the neighbor advertising the prefix since there is already a default route pointing to it.
