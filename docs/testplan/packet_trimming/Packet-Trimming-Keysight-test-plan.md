## Overview

In traditional packet loss handling, when a lossy queue exceeds its buffer threshold, packets are silently dropped without notifying the destination host. While packet recovery can occur via fast retransmission or timeout-based retransmission, the latter method introduces significant latency, degrading application performance.

Packet Trimming is an enhancement mechanism designed to optimize network performance during congestion conditions. Instead of dropping packets, it will trim packets to a configured size and try sending them on a different queue (usually a higher-priority queue) to deliver packet drop notifications to the end host. The end host can then quickly send a retransmission request for the trimmed packet to the source device. This speeds up retransmissions and reduces network latency.

### Scope

The test cases included in this document aim to verify the following:
1. Packet trimming counters for lossy egress queues on SONiC switches are accurate. This will be verified by comparing the counter values with the number of trimmed packets received on the Keysight RX port.
2. Rate of trimmed packets received on the Keysight RX port is as expected. This expected rate depends on the rate of packets received per second from the Keysight TX port(s), rate-limit imposed on the SONiC TX port (or the line rate of the SONiC TX port if there is no imposed rate-limit), and DWRR weights for different queues.

Keysight ports are connected via SONiC switch as shown in the illustration above.

The Keysight device is connected to 5 ports of the SONiC DUT (4 ports for TX and 1 port for RX).

## Packet Trimming on SONiC

To configure packet trimming on the SONiC DUT, use the following command:

<code>config switch-trimming global --size {s} --dscp {d} --queue {q}</code>

In the above command, `s` is the size of packets after trimming (in bytes), `d` is the DSCP value assigned to trimmed packets, and `q` is the egress queue number used to send out trimmed packets.

**Note:** In our tests, we set trimmed packet size to 256.

You also need to enable packet trimming for the buffer profile associated with the egress queue:

<code>config mmu -p {buffer_profile_name} -t on</code>

To see buffer profiles configured on the DUT, you can use the following command:

<code>show mmu</code>

Queue-level counters must be enabled prior to running tests:

<code>counterpoll queue enable</code>

The default update interval for queue counters is 10 seconds. It is recommended that you set this interval to a small value (e.g., 1 second) so that the counter is updated frequently:

<code>counterpoll queue interval 1000</code>

The following command will display the number of dropped and trimmed packets per queue for every queue of every port:

<code>show queue counters --all</code>

Queue-level counters can be reset using the following command:

<code>sonic-clear queuecounters</code>

The counters should be reset before each test.


### Creating Congestion on SONiC Egress Queues

In order to test the Packet Trimming feature, we need to create congestion on the SONiC egress queue so that the queue becomes full and the switch starts trimming packets that would be otherwise dropped. For unicast (1-to-1) test cases, we need to rate-limit the egress queue to create congestion (since we assume that all ports have the same speed). For incast test cases (2-to-1 or 4-to-1), congestion should happen without any extra effort. However, in some incast tests we will rate-limit the egress queue so that trimmed packets are not dropped by the DUT due to congestion.

We can rate-limit a queue by using a scheduler. First, we need to find the scheduler that is used for a particular queue. For example, to
find the scheduler for `Ethernet100|6`, we can use the following command:

<code>sonic-db-cli CONFIG_DB HGET "QUEUE|Ethernet100|6" "scheduler"</code>

Then, we can limit the rate of packets that can be added to the egress queue per second as follows (assuming that the above command returned `scheduler.0`):

<code>sonic-db-cli CONFIG_DB HSET "SCHEDULER|scheduler.0" "pir" "100" "meter_type" "packets"</code>

The above command will limit the rate of packets allowed into `Ethernet100|6` to 100 packets per second.

**Note:** If no scheduler is configured for the test egress queue (e.g., `Ethernet100|6`), then we can define one and associate it with the queue using the following commands:

<code>sonic-db-cli CONFIG_DB HSET "SCHEDULER|test_scheduler" "type" "DWRR" "weight" "15" "pir" "100" "meter_type" "packets"</code>

<code>sonic-db-cli CONFIG_DB HSET "QUEUE|Ethernet100|6" "scheduler" "test_scheduler"</code>

## Setup Configuration

## Test Cases (Validating Packet Trimming Counters)

### Test Objective

These tests aim to verify that the DUT’s packet trimming counters for egress queues are accurate.

### Test Parameters
Here are the parameters used to generate different test cases:

1. The number of SONiC RX ports: Can be 1 (unicast), 2, 4, 10, or 20 (incast).
2. All SONiC test ports belong to the same memory module or they belong to different memory modules.
3. Randomly-picked lossy egress queue $i$. All ingress test traffic to the DUT will be mapped to this queue. The index of this queue must be different from the queue index that trimmed packets will be sent to (configured using the `config switch-trimming global` command).
4. Using IPv4 or IPv6 packets in tests.
5. Whether rate-limiting is applied to queue $i$ or not.
