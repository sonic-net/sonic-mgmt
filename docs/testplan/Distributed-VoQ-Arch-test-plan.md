# Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

This is the test plan for SONIC Distributed VOQ support, as described in the [Distributed VOQ HLD](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/blob/master/doc/voq/voq_hld.md). 

The associated PRs covered in this test plan are:

1. [Distributed VOQ PR 380](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss-common/pull/380)
2. [Distributed VOQ PR 657](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-sairedis/pull/657)
3. [Distributed VOQ PR 1431](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/1431)

Redis CLI commands will be used for some validation until SONIC CLI commands are available for system port information.

## Scope

The functionalty covered in this test plan is:
* system ports, 
* router interfaces, when configured on multiple cards, and
* neighbors, when learned on local and remote ports. 

Other HLDs in the [Chassis Subgroup feature list](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/wiki/SONiC-Chassis-Subgroup) will be covered in other test plans.

## Debuggability  <a name="debug"></a>
The following are useful commands for validating the testcases that follow.

1. Keys from redis in container when no redis-dump exists:

`docker exec database1 redis-cli -h <ip> -n 6 KEYS "*"`

2. Values from redis in container when no redis-dump exists:

`docker exec database1 redis-cli -h <ip> -n 6 hgetall "SYSTEM_NEIGH_TABLE|Inband4|3.3.3.5"`

3. Chassis App Database on Supervisor card:

`redis-dump -h <ip> -p 6380 -d 12 -y -k "*SYSTEM_INT*"`


# Test Setup <a name="test-setup"></a>

These test cases will be run in the proposed [T2 topology](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt/pull/2638/). It is assumed that such a configuration is deployed on the chassis.

### Configuration

Please reference the [T2 topology](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt/pull/2638/) files topo_t2.yml and testbed-t2.png for network topology and sample IP addresses.  The addresses and VMS below are taken from that example topology.
