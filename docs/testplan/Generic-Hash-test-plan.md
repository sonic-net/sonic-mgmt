## 1. Overview
The hashing algorithm is used to make traffic-forwarding decisions for traffic exiting the switch.
It makes hashing decisions based on values in various packet fields, as well as on the hash seed value.
The packet fields used by the hashing algorithm varies by the configuration on the switch.

For ECMP, the hashing algorithm determines how incoming traffic is forwarded to the next-hop device.
For LAG, the hashing algorithm determines how traffic is placed onto the LAG member links to manage
bandwidth by evenly load-balancing traffic across the outgoing links.

Generic Hash is a feature which allows user to configure which hash fields suppose to be used by hashing algorithm by providing global switch hash configuration for ECMP and LAG.

The sonic-mgmt generic hash tests validate whether the hash configurations can be applied successfully and the hash behaviour is as expected.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 The Generic Hash feature supports the following functionality:
1. Ethernet packet hashing configuration with inner/outer IP frames
2. Global switch hash configuration for ECMP and LAG
3. Warm/Fast reboot

### 2.2 This feature will support the following commands:

1. config: set switch hash global configuration
2. show: display switch hash global configuration or capabilities

### 2.3 This feature will provide error handling for the next situations:

#### 2.3.1 Frontend
**This feature will provide error handling for the next situations:**
1. Invalid parameter value
#### 2.3.2 Backend
**This feature will provide error handling for the next situations:**
1. Missing parameters
2. Invalid parameter value
3. Parameter removal
4. Configuration removal

## 3. Scope

The test is to verify the hash configuration can be added/updated by the generic hash, and the ECMP and lag hash behavior will change according to the generic hash configurations.

### 3.1 Scale / Performance

No scale or performance test related

### 3.2 CLI commands

#### 3.2.1 Config
The following command can be used to configure generic hash:
```
config
|--- switch-hash
     |--- global
          |--- ecmp-hash ARGS
          |--- lag-hash ARGS
```

Examples:
The following command updates switch hash global:
```
config switch-hash global ecmp-hash \
'DST_MAC' \
'SRC_MAC' \
'ETHERTYPE' \
'IP_PROTOCOL' \
'DST_IP' \
'SRC_IP' \
'L4_DST_PORT' \

```
```

### Notes:
  1. The tested hash field in each test case is randomly selected from a pre-defined field list per asic type. Currently these fields are tested as default: 'IN_PORT', 'SRC_MAC', 'DST_MAC', 'ETHERTYPE', 'VLAN_ID', 'IP_PROTOCOL', 'SRC_IP', 'DST_IP', 'L4_SRC_PORT', 'L4_DST_PORT', 'INNER_SRC_IP', 'INNER_DST_IP'.
  2. DST_MAC, ETHERTYPE, VLAN_ID fields are only tested in lag hash test cases, because L2 traffic is needed to test these fields, and there is no ecmp hash when the traffic is fowarded in L2.
  3. IPv4 and IPv6 are covered in the test, but the versions(including the inner version when testing the inner fields) are randomly selected in the test cases.
  4. For the inner fields, three types of encapsulations are covered: IPinIP, VxLAN and NVGRE. For the VxLAN packet, the default port 4789 and a custom port 13330 are covered in the test.
  5. For the reboot test, reboot type is randomly selected from config reload, cold, warm and fast reboot.
  6. The random selections of hash fields, ip versions, encapsulation types and reboot types can be controlled by pytest options. The user is able to set each of the option as 'random', 'all', or a specific value.
