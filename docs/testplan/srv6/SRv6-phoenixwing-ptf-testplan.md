## Overview
The PhoenixWing Initiative aims to incorporate SRv6 features and some infrastructure level enhancements into the SONiC community code base. In the short term, the objective is to assess the deployment readiness of SRv6 solutions via using the SONiC 202411 release on participated hardware devices. The long term goals include to promote more SONiC based SRv6 deployments via finalizingg the testing toolkit for the SRv6 solutions. This document marks the initial step of testing within this initiative. The focus of this document is to verify all needed functionalities and enhancements via running test casess on a 7-node PTF testbed.

### Scopes
The main scopes for this document include the following information

1. Enhance current sonic-mgmt pytest infra to support 7-node PTF testbed.
   1. Create a 5-node PTF testbed which mimic current topo_t0.yml.
2. The 7-node PTF test cases for verifying in the following areas
   1. Basic Sanity
   2. SRv6 VPN
   3. SRv6 Policy with SBFD

Note: The scale, convergence, performance related test cases would be covered in a seperated spytest test plan.

## Enhance sonic-mgmt Test Infra
### Use vSONiC with NPU simulated data plane
We aim to set up two types of testbeds. One is with 5 vSONiC instances which mimics topo_t0.yml for running SONiC existing test cases. The other one is a 7-node PTF testbed using a total of 7 vSONiC instances for SRv6 testing. Currently, we utilize vSONiC instances with the hardware SKU as "cisco-8101-p4-32x100-vs". This type of vSONiC instance enables us not only to validate control plane programming, but also to handle high throughput data plane SRv6 traffic, which effectively simulates the behavior of a forwarding chip.

Note:
The infra changes are merged to sonic-mgmt via https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/pull/13785

#### 5-node Testbed
This testbed's topology file is located at ansible/vars/topo_ciscovs-5nodes.yml. It mimics topo_t0.yml except it uses  "cisco-8101-p4-32x100-vs" as vsonic instance for all 5 nodes. The purpose for this testbed is to secure exsiting SONiC code sanity via running existing SONiC Test cases. Since all test cases are existing codes, we don't need to discuss them in this document.

#### 7-node Testbed
In this testbed, three vSONiC instatnces are used as PE (Provider Edge) devices. They are connected with PTF via Ethernet24 from each node. These ports are VRF ports, a.k.a customer facing ports. The remaining four vSONiC instances are used as P (Provider) devices. They form a v6 only fabric which is used to connect PE devices. Since this is a new type of test topology, we use the rest sections to describe the changes to set up this topology and test cases would run on it.

### Enhancements in the topology file
We have created a new topology file located at ansible/vars/topo_ciscovs-7nodes.yml. This file describes this 7-node setup. The current pytest framework in sonic-mgmt is designed for testing individual devices using Ansible. While it can launch multiple VMs as helper VMs, it does not support establishing links between them. To address this limitation, we have extended the existing infrastructure by adding two new options to set up links between these VMs.

#### VM_LINKs
VM_LINKs is a set of simple point to point link between two VMs.
```
  VM_LINKs:
    PE1P3:
      start_vm_offset: 0
      start_vm_port_idx: 1
      end_vm_offset: 3
      end_vm_port_idx: 1
    PE2P3:
      start_vm_offset: 1
      start_vm_port_idx: 2
      end_vm_offset: 3
      end_vm_port_idx: 2
```

We use a Linux bridge to link each pair of VMs. We could use "brctl show" to find out these linux bridges at the host machine.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
br-b-vms9-1             8000.8a6061a54580       no              VM0100-back

                                                        VM0103-back

                                                        ptf-vms9-1-m
                                                        vlab-c-01-0
br_link1                8000.fe54004e04d7       no              VM0100-t1

                                                        VM0104-t1
br_link4                8000.fe540031113d       no              VM0103-t4
                                                        VM0105-t1
br_link5                8000.fe5400cf517e       no              VM0104-t2
                                                        VM0105-t2
```

#### OVS_LINKs
OVS_LINKs is a set of links which also has a connection with the PTF docker. This type of links could be used for running some PTF traffic verification. In this test plan, we use these links for verifying SRv6 encapsulated packets. "vlans" in the following configuration represent the ports connected with in ptf docker. This usage is the same as DUT's vlans usage in the topology file.

Note: we don't want to add all links as OVS links, due to the following two reasons
1. Limited ports in PTF docker
2. We observe more chances to get ovs-switch crashed when the number of ovs flows used goes up.

```
  OVS_LINKs:
    P2PE3:
      vlans:
        - 39
      start_vm_offset: 4
      start_vm_port_idx: 3
      end_vm_offset: 2
      end_vm_port_idx: 1
    P4PE3:
      vlans:
        - 40
      start_vm_offset: 5
      start_vm_port_idx: 3
      end_vm_offset: 2
      end_vm_port_idx: 3
```
We could use "ovs-vsctl show" to find out ovs bridges first.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo ovs-vsctl show
c4e06a39-342c-489b-be81-09fbad6c739c
    Bridge br_ovs6
        Port VM0104-t3
            Interface VM0104-t3
        Port br_ovs6
            Interface br_ovs6
                type: internal
        Port VM0102-t1
            Interface VM0102-t1
        Port inje-vms9-1-39
            Interface inje-vms9-1-39
...
```
Then we could use "ovs-ofctl dump-flows <bridge-name> to check flows and counters.
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows br_ovs6
 cookie=0x0, duration=7718.212s, table=0, n_packets=522, n_bytes=93445, in_port="VM0102-t1" actions=output:"VM0104-t3"
 cookie=0x0, duration=7717.895s, table=0, n_packets=257, n_bytes=68105, priority=3,in_port="VM0104-t3" actions=output:"VM0102-t1",output:"inje-vms9-1-39"
 cookie=0x0, duration=7717.812s, table=0, n_packets=4, n_bytes=280, in_port="inje-vms9-1-39" actions=output:"VM0104-t3"
 cookie=0x0, duration=7718.202s, table=0, n_packets=0, n_bytes=0, priority=10,tcp,in_port="VM0104-t3",tp_src=179 actions=output:"VM0102-t1",output:"inje-vms9-1-39"
 cookie=0x0, duration=7718.168s, table=0, n_packets=0, n_bytes=0, priority=10,tcp,in_port="VM0104-t3",tp_src=22 actions=output:"VM0102-t1",output:"inje-vms9-1-39"
 cookie=0x0, duration=7718.158s, table=0, n_packets=264, n_bytes=25384, priority=10,tcp6,in_port="VM0104-t3",tp_src=179 actions=output:"VM0102-t1",output:"inje-vms9-1-39"

 ...
```
### Setup configuration files
Instead of using minigraph xml, we want to use configdb json files to apply initial underlay configuraiton to each device. Topology file uses init_cfg_profile to provide each device's config profile keyword. It is a logical view presentation.
```
init_cfg_profile: 7nodes_cisco_P1

max_fp_num_provided : 6

configuration:
  PE1:
    init_cfg_profile: 7nodes_cisco_PE1
    hwsku: cisco-8101-p4-32x100-vs
    bgp:
      asn: 64600
    bp_interface:
      ipv4: 10.10.246.29/24
      ipv6: fc0a::29/64
```

init_cfg_profiles.yml is used to provide a mapping table from profile keywords to config file locations.
```
7nodes_cisco_PE1: vars/configdb_jsons/7nodes_cisco/PE1.json
7nodes_cisco_PE2: vars/configdb_jsons/7nodes_cisco/PE2.json
7nodes_cisco_PE3: vars/configdb_jsons/7nodes_cisco/PE3.json
7nodes_cisco_P1: vars/configdb_jsons/7nodes_cisco/P1.json
7nodes_cisco_P2: vars/configdb_jsons/7nodes_cisco/P2.json
7nodes_cisco_P3: vars/configdb_jsons/7nodes_cisco/P3.json
7nodes_cisco_P4: vars/configdb_jsons/7nodes_cisco/P4.json
```

This test case's configuration files are stored at ansible/vars/configdb_jsons/7nodes_cisco/.

### Launch 7-node PTF Testbed
We follow existing work flow to launch this testbed in three steps. P1 is the DUT from existing pytest infrastructure's point of view.

#### Launch six helper VMs
Use the exsiting testbed-cli.sh's option start-topo-vms to start helper VMs based on the defined topology file. The sample launching command is the following.

```
cd /data/sonic-mgmt/ansible;  export PACKAGE_INSTALLATION=false; ./testbed-cli.sh -t vtestbed.csv -m veos_vtb  -k vsonic  start-topo-vms vms-kvm-ciscovs-7nodes password.txt'
```

Note: PACKAGE_INSTALLATION is set to let pytest skip package installation. The default behavior is always to install packages which include docker. This docker installation causes the problem since the command needs to be executed inside docker sonic-mgmt-test.

#### Start DUT VM and bind all VMs based on the defined topology file
Use the exsiting testbed-cli.sh's option add-topo to start DUT VM, a.k.a P1 in this topology. This step would also set up needed links among 7 VMs and apply configurations to previous launched helper VMs
```
cd /data/sonic-mgmt/ansible;  export PACKAGE_INSTALLATION=false; ./testbed-cli.sh -t vtestbed.csv -m veos_vtb  -k vsonic  add-topo vms-kvm-ciscovs-7nodes password.txt
```
#### Apply DUT's configuration
Use the exsiting testbed-cli.sh's option deploy-mg to apply configurations to DUT,
```
cd /data/sonic-mgmt/ansible;  export PACKAGE_INSTALLATION=false; ./testbed-cli.sh -t vtestbed.csv -m veos_vtb  -k vsonic  deploy-mg vms-kvm-ciscovs-7nodes veos_vtb password.txt'
```
#### Run Test Cases
We use the following command to run test cases on this 7-node testbed. Some options used are highlighted below

* "-c" is used to specify test cases.
* "-u" is used to skip pretest and posttest, since we don't use minigraph configurations.
* "-e  --neighbor_type=sonic" is to tell pytest that all nodes are vSONiC, so use pick up sonic defined user name and password.
* "-e --skip_sanity" is to tell pytest to skip_sanity check for SRv6 test cases when minigraph is not used. This flag could be removed laster.
* "-n" is to identify topology
* "-d" is to specify the DUT node name

```
python3 -m venv ~/env-python3 ; source ~/env-python3/bin/activate;  cd /data/sonic-mgmt/tests; ./run_tests.sh -n vms-kvm-ciscovs-7nodes -d vlab-c-01  -c srv6/srv6_basic_sanity.py  -f vtestbed.yaml -i ../ansible/veos_vtb  -u  -e --disable_loganalyzer -e --neighbor_type=sonic -e --skip_sanity
```

## Test Plan
### Basic Sanity
The purpose for this set of test cases is to provide basic sanity checks before running other test cases. The following two test cases are added.

```
srv6/srv6_basic_sanity.py::test_interface_on_each_node PASSED            [ 50%]
srv6/srv6_basic_sanity.py::test_check_bgp_neighbors PASSED               [100%]
```
1. test_interface_on_each_node is to check if all interfaces are deteced from each node.
2. test_check_bgp_neighbors is to check that underlay BGP sessions are up.

### SRv6 VPN
#### SRv6 VPN for single homing
Publish VRF routes from PE1 to PE3, and run traffic from PE3 to P1. Use traffic to check VPN traffic works. Local PE and remote PE's MY_SID's add, delete and modification would be verified in this test case.
#### SRv6 VPN for Dual homing
Publish VRF routes from PE1 and PE2 to PE3, and run traffic from PE3 to P1. Use traffic to check VPN traffic works with dual homing. Local PE and remote PE's MY_SID's add, delete and modification would be verified in this test case.

#### IGP local failure case
Shut down port between P2 and PE3, use FRR zebra debug to check quick fixup kicked in for local link failure case.  Run VPN traffic check from PE3 to PE1 and PE2. Recover this link after the test.

Use PTF to publish some V6 IGP routes to P1, a.k.a increase PE3's IGP level route scale. Need to make sure the quick fixup would be handled before IGP routes.

#### IGP remote failure case
Shut down the links (P2, P1), (P2, P3), (P2, P4) to simulate remote IGP failure.  Use FRR zebra debug to check quick fixup kicked in and IGP convergece would not impact overlay convergence. Run VPN traffic check from PE3 to PE1 and PE2. Recover this link after the test.

Use PTF to publish some V6 IGP routes to P1, a.k.a increase PE3's IGP level route scale. Need to make sure the quick fixup would be handled before IGP routes.

#### BGP remote PE failure case
Shut down the links (PE2, P1), (PE2, P3) to simulate remote PE ndoe failure. Use FRR zebra debug to check quick fixup kicked in. Run VPN traffic check from PE3 to PE1 and PE2. Recover this link after the test.

### SRv6 Policy and SBFD
#### Verification of End End.DX4 and End.DX6 Functions
Configure an SRv6 Policy on the PE3 router, ensuring segment list includes End End.DX4 and End.DX6 SID, verify that traffic behaves as expected.
#### SRv6 policy with single or multiple candidate-paths
Configure multiple candidate-paths for one policy, and run traffic from PE3 to P1. Use traffic to check policy traffic works.
1. Configure candidate-path with different preference and enable S-BFD, verify that traffic behaves as expected. Shutdown S-BFD of the high preference candidate-path ,  the traffic switches to the lower-priority candidate-path.
2. Configure multiple candidate-paths with identical preference and enable S-BFD, verify that traffic behaves as expected (ECMP over candidate-paths).
#### SRv6 policies
Deploy multiple SRv6 TE policies between the PEs, and enable S-BFD. Publish same routes from PE1 and PE2 respectively to PE3.
1. Verify that traffic behaves as expected (ECMP over policies).
2. Shutdown the S-BFD of one policy, verify that traffic behaves as expected.
#### SRv6-TE and SRv6-BE hybrid mode
Deploy SRv6 TE policy between PE1 and PE3 and SRv6 BE between PE2 and PE3. Publish same routes from PE1 and PE2 respectively to PE3.
1. In this case, routes will recursion to the SRv6 TE Polic. Verify that traffic behaves as expected.
2. Shutdown the SRv6 TE Polic, routes will recursion to the SRv6 BE, verify that traffic behaves as expected.
