**SONiC P-NAC TEST PLAN**

**Overview:**

Network access control (NAC), also known as network admission control, is the process of restricting unauthorized users and devices from accessing a network. NAC ensures that only users who are authenticated and devices that are authorized and compliant with security policies can enter the network. It restricts the availability of network resources to endpoint devices and users that are authorized and comply with the defined security policy. 

**Scope:** 

The tests outlined below are targeted towards validating the NAC functionality on a SONIC system. The testing will be done on Edgecore AS7716 target platform supporting NAC functionality. The NAC functionality should support “local” authentication
