# Transceiver Onboarding Test Plan

## Scope

This test plan outlines a comprehensive framework for ensuring feature parity for new transceivers being onboarded to SONiC. The goal is to automate all tests listed in this document, covering the following areas:

- **Link Behavior**: Test link behavior using shut/no shut commands and under process crash and device reboot scenarios.
- **Transceiver Information Fields**: Verify transceiver specific fields (Vendor name, part number, serial number) via CLI commands, ensuring values match expectations.
- **Firmware**: Check firmware version readability and compliance with vendor-suggested values, using regex for version pattern matching.
- **DOM Data**: Ensure Digital Optical Monitoring (DOM) data is correctly read and within acceptable ranges.
- **Flags and Alerts**: Confirm no unexpected flags (e.g., Loss of Signal (LOS), Loss of Lock (LOL), DOM warnings) are set.
- **Firmware Management**: Test firmware upgrade under various scenarios.
- **Remote Reseat**: Verify support for remote reseat functionality.

**Transceiver Specific Capabilities** (if available):

- Adjustments to frequency and tx power.
- Configuration of different Forward Error Correction (FEC) modes.
- For breakout cables, ensure specific lanes are correctly modified by shut/no shut or other lane specific commands.

**Optics Scope**:
The test plan includes various optics types, such as:

- Active Optical Cables (AOC)
- Active Electrical Cables (AEC)
- DR8 optics
- Direct Attach Cables (DAC)
- Short Range/Long Range (SR/LR) optics
- SONiC-supported breakout cables

**Optics Specifications**:
Tests will cover optics compliant with:

- CMIS
- C-CMIS
- SFF-8636
- SFF-8436
- SFF-8472

## Testbed Topology

A total of 2 ports of a device with the onboarding transceiver should be connected with a cable. Each of these ports can be on the same device or different devices as well. In the case of a breakout cable, the expectation is to connect all sides of the cable to the DUT and test each port individually.

1. Standalone topology with both ports connected on the same SONiC device (self loopback)

    ```text
    +-----------------+
    |           Port 1|<----+
    |                 |     | Loopback
    |    Device       |     | Connection
    |           Port 2|<----+
    |                 |
    +-----------------+
    ```

2. Point-to-point topology with port connected on different SONiC devices

    ```text

    +-----------------+     +-----------------+
    |           Port 1|<--->|Port 1           |
    |                 |     |                 |
    |    Device 1     |     |     Device 2    |
    |                 |     |                 |
    |                 |     |                 |
    +-----------------+     +-----------------+
    ```

3. Topology with port connected between SONiC device and 2 servers using a Y-cable

    ```text
                               +-----------------+
                               |                 |
                               |     Server 1    |
    +-----------------+        |                 |
    |                 |    +-->| Port            |
    |                 |    |   |                 |
    |   SONiC Device  |    |   +-----------------+

    +-----------------+    +-->| Port            |
                               |                 |
                               |                 |
                               +-----------------+
    ```

## Test Cases

### 1. Tests not involving traffic

These tests do not require traffic and are standalone, designed to run on a Device Under Test (DUT) with the transceiver plugged into 2 ports, connected by a cable.

**Breakout Cable Assumptions for the Below Tests:**

- All sides of the breakout cable should be connected to the DUT, and each port should be tested individually starting from subport 1 to subport N. The test should be run in reverse order as well i.e. starting from subport N to subport 1.
- For link toggling tests on a subport, it's crucial to ensure that the link status of remaining subports of the breakout port group remains unaffected.

**Pre-requisites for the Below Tests:**

1. A file `transceiver_common_attributes.csv` should be present to describe the common attributes of the transceiver based on vendor part number. Following should be the format of the file

    ```csv
    vendor_pn,active_firmware,inactive_firmware,cmis_rev,vendor_name,dual_bank_support
    <vendor_pn_1>,<active_firmware_version_1>,<inactive_firmware_version_1>,<cmis_revision_1>,<vendor_name_1>,<True or False>
    <vendor_pn_2>,<active_firmware_version_2>,<inactive_firmware_version_2>,<cmis_revision_2>,<vendor_name_2>,<True or False>
    # Add more vendor part numbers as needed
    ```

2. A file `transceiver_dut_info.csv` should be present to describe the metadata of the DUT. Following should be the format of the file

    ```csv
    dut_name,port,vendor_date,vendor_oui,vendor_rev,vendor_sn,vendor_pn
    dut_name_1,port_1,vendor_date_code,vendor_oui,revision_number,serial_number,vendor_part_number
    dut_name_1,port_2,vendor_date_code,vendor_oui,revision_number,serial_number,vendor_part_number
    # Add more DUTs as needed
    ```

Functionality to parse the above files and store the data in a dictionary should be implemented in the test framework. This dictionary should act as a source of truth for the test cases.
The vendor_part_number from `transceiver_dut_info.csv` file should be used to fetch the common attributes of the transceiver from `transceiver_common_attributes.csv` file for a given port.  
Example of an dictionary created by parsing the above files

```python
{
    "dut_name_1": {
        "port_1": {
            "vendor_date": "vendor_date_code",
            "vendor_oui": "vendor_oui",
            "vendor_rev": "revision_number",
            "vendor_sn": "serial_number",
            "vendor_pn": "vendor_part_number",
            "active_firmware": "active_firmware_version",
            "inactive_firmware": "inactive_firmware_version",
            "cmis_rev": "cmis_revision",
            "vendor_name": "vendor_name",
            "dual_bank_support": "True or False"
        },
        "port_2": {
            "vendor_date": "vendor_date_code",
            "vendor_oui": "vendor_oui",
            "vendor_rev": "revision_number",
            "vendor_sn": "serial_number",
            "vendor_pn": "vendor_part_number",
            "active_firmware": "active_firmware_version",
            "inactive_firmware": "inactive_firmware_version",
            "cmis_rev": "cmis_revision",
            "vendor_name": "vendor_name",
            "dual_bank_support": "True or False"
        }
    }
}
```
