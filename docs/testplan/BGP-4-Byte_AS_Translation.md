### Test case #1 - 4-byte AS Translation

#### Test objective

Have a single neighbor configured with 4-byte ASN.
Step 1: Configure DUT and neighbor with 4-Byte ASN
Step 2: Verify 4-byte BGP session between DUT and neighbor is established
Step 3: Verify BGP is established for 4-byte neighbor and down for 2-byte neighbors
Step 3: Configure DUT to use 2-byte local-ASN for 2-byte neighbors
Step 4: Verify BGP is now established for 4-byte neighbor AND 2-byte neighbors
Step 5: Verify 2-byte neighbors receive routes from upstream 4-byte routers
