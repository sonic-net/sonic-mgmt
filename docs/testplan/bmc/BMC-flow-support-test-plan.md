## Overview

Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) is a specialized microcontroller that provide out-of-band remote monitoring and management capabilities for servers/switches. It operates independently of the switch's main CPU and operating system, allowing administrators to manage the switch even when it is powered off or unresponsive. BMC is a powerful tool that can be used to automate and simplify many tasks associated with managing switches. It can help to improve network efficiency, reliability, and security.

OpenBMC is an open-source project that provides a Linux-based firmware stack for BMC. It implements the Redfish standard, allowing for standardized and secure remote management of server hardware. OpenBMC serves as the software that runs on BMC hardware, utilizing the Redfish API to facilitate efficient hardware management.

Redfish is a standard for managing and interacting with hardware in a datacenter, designed to be simple, secure, and scalable. It works with BMC to provide a RESTful API for remote management of servers. Together, Redfish and BMC enable efficient and standardized hardware management.

In summary, NOS will deal with BMC through the Redfish RESTful API.

## Scope

The test is to verify the SONiC BMC platform apis which have been exposed to the user and SONiC command lines defined for BMC.
