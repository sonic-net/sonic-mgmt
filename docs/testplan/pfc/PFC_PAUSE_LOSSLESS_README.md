This document describes how to test if PFC can pause lossless priorities at the switch

## Background
PFC pause frames can prevent a switch queue from sending any data in a time interval. The PFC frame (Figure 1 in https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-7000-series-switches/white_paper_c11-542809.html) has a 8-bit field called 'cass-enable vector' where the bit N tells if the frame pauses priority N. The bit value of 1 means pause. For a priority to pause, the PFC frame also needs to specify its pause duration. The PFC frame has 8 pause durations fields, one for each priority. The pause duration for each priority is a 2-byte value that expresses time as a number of quanta, where each quanta represents the time needed to transmit 512 bits at the current network speed. For example, the value of 65535 at a 40 Gbps link means 65535 * 512bits / 40Gbps = 838.84 microseconds. Therefore, to fully block a switch queue, we need to generate PFC pause frames fast enough. For example, to block 40G link, we need to generate a PFC pause frame with 65535 quantas in every 838.84 microseconds. A pause duration of zero quanta has the special meaning of unpausing a priority. 

SONiC has two lossless priorities: 3 and 4, by default. Note that only the lossless priorities can react to or generate PFC frames. In other words, PFC frames should not have any impact on traffic on lossy priorities. Packets with Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) 3 and 4 are mapped to priority 3 and 4, respectively.

## Testbed Setup
The testbed consists of two IXIA ports and a SONiC device under test (DUT) as follows. Both IXIA ports should have the same bandwidth capacity. To reduce the configuration complexity, we recommond configuring the switch as a Top of Rack (ToR) / Tier 0 (T0) switch and binding two switch interfaces to the Vlan. 

```
                     _________
                    |         |
IXIA tx port ------ |   DUT   |------ IXIA rx port
                    |_________|
```
In addition, [PFC watchdog](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/wiki/PFC-Watchdog-Design) must be disabled at the SONiC DUT. Otherwise, the DUT will trigger PFC watchdog to drop packets when it detects persistent PFC pause storms. The command to disable PFC watchdog is <code>sudo pfcwd stop</code>.

## Experiment Steps
In this experiment, we need to create three traffic items:

- Test data traffic: Data packets sent from the IXIA tx port to the IXIA rx port at the lossless priorities (e.g., e.g., 3, 4 or both 3 and 4) that we want to test. Note that the packets should be marked with the correct DSCP value (e.g., DSCP 3 for priority 3). The traffic demand should be 50% of the line rate.

- Background data traffic: Data packets sent from the IXIA tx port to the IXIA rx port at the other priorities that we want to test (e.g., 0-2 and 5-7). The traffic demand should be 50% of the line rate.

- PFC pause storm: Persistent PFC pause frames from the IXIA rx port to the IXIA tx port. The priorities of PFC pause frames should be same as those of test data traffic. And the inter-frame transmission interval should be smaller than per-frame pause duration. 
  
This experiment needs the following five steps:

- Start the PFC pause storm to fully block the test priorities at the switch. 
  
- After a fixed duration (e.g., 1 second), start test data traffic and background data traffic simultaneously. 

- After a fixed duration (e.g., 5 seconds), stop test data traffic and background data traffic. 
  
- Check if the IXIA rx port receives (1) all the sent frames of background data traffic (which should not be impacted by PFC), and (2) zero frame of test data traffic (which should be fully blocked by PFC pause storm). Check if (3) the total number of transmitted bytes of test data traffic is smaller than the switch shared buffer size.

- Stop PFC pause storm
