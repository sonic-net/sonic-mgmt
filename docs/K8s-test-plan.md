# Overview

### Background
 Each SONiC DUT is considered a worker node managed by the Kubernetes master. From the master, we can deploy upgrades to SONiC features running in kube mode with minimal downtime and without requiring reimaging of the entire SONiC buildimage. A [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/#:~:text=Synopsis,object%20that%20describes%20a%20pod.) agent runs on each SONiC DUT to communicate with the Kubernetes master.
 
 SONiC features can run in either kube mode or local mode. SONiC features (dockers) running in local mode use the image tagged `{feature_name}:latest` in the local image store and run independent of the Kubernetes master. SONiC features running in kube mode use the image sourced from the URL specified in the Kubernetes manifest and are managed by the Kubernetes master.  Features in SONiC have the ability to switch between kube mode and local mode. For more background on Kubernetes features in SONiC and kube mode vs local mode, refer to [this document](https://github.com/renukamanavalan/SONiC/blob/kube_systemd/doc/kubernetes/Kubernetes-support.md). 

### Scope
This test plan aims to ensure proper Kubernetes management of SONiC features running in kube mode, and seamless transition of a SONiC feature between kube mode and local mode.

### Testbed
Kubernetes tests require a Kubernetes master reachable from the SONiC DUT. In order to connect each SONiC DUT to a High Availability Kubernetes master, we need to set up the following topology on a testbed server: 
![alt text](https://github.com/isabelmsft/k8s-ha-master-starlab/blob/master/k8s-testbed-linux.png)

To set up the high availability Kubernetes master, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/ansible/doc/README.testbed.k8s.Setup.md#how-to-setup-high-availability-kubernetes-master).

# Test Cases
These test cases focus on Device Under Test (DUT) status changes in response to different configurations. {feature x} represents the single SONiC feature/container under test. 

Each DUT has the following key configurations related to the Kubernetes server:
- `disable` flag enables and disables the Kubernetes master. `disable=false `enables DUT to join Kubernetes master to allow Kubernetes management of SONiC features. `disable=true` triggers the DUT to reset from Kubernetes master, enforcing local management of all SONiC features. Configured via CLI command: `sudo config kube server disable {on/off}`
- `ip` is the VIP of the high availability Kubernetes master. In these test cases, we assume that the VIP is configured properly. Configured via CLI command: `sudo config kube server ip {VIP}`

Each DUT has the following key configurations related to each SONiC feature:
- `set_owner` specifies desired owner for each feature- either local or kube. Configured via CLI command: `sudo config feature owner {feature x} {kube/local}`

Each DUT has the following key statuses related to Kubernetes server: 
- `connected` true means that the DUT has successfully joined to high availability Kubernetes master. Observed via CLI command: `show kube server status`

Each DUT has the following key statuses related to each SONiC feature: 
- `container_version` keeps track of which version is currently running for each feature.
- `remote_state` describes the state of Kubernetes-managed container (`stopped`, `running`, `pending`, or `none`) for each feature. 
- `current_owner` describes the current owner for each feature- either local or kube.
- All {feature x} statuses are observed via CLI command `show feature status {feature x}`

## Test Scenario: Join/Reset
