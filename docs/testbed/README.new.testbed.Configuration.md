# Sonic-Mgmt Testbed Setup
Setting up the sonic-mgmt testbed from Github to your own environment can be a tedious process. There are 10+ files that need to be updated before you can run test cases.

However, this process can be automated with the testbed.yaml file and TestbedProcessing.py script. The testbed.yaml file is a configuration file that compiles all the data needed to run the testcases into one file. TestbedProcess.py works by pulling information from that configuration file and pushing the data into the files where they belong. This guide will outline and facilitate the testbed set up of sonic-mgmt.


# Objective
The objective of this guide is to outline and facilitate the process of using the testbed.yaml and TestbedProcessing.py files. At the end of this guide, you should be able to setup the sonic-mgmt testbed and run the testcases.

Information for basic set up can be referenced at [Sonic-Mgmt Testbed Setup](/docs/testbed/README.testbed.Setup.md).


# Pre-migration Setup
There are several devices needed to get sonic-mgmt up and running with the test cases:
- Lab Server
- Root Fanout
- Leaf Fanout
- DUT (Device Under Test)

Information for testbed and topology can be referenced at [Sonic-Mgmt Testbed Overview](/docs/testbed/README.testbed.Overview.md)

# Testbed inventory

- [```ansible/lab```](/ansible/lab): Include all lab DUTs, fanout switches and testbed server topologies

- [```ansible/veos```](/ansible/veos): all servers and VMs


## Testbed Physical Topology

- [```ansible/files/sonic_lab_devices.csv```](/ansible/files/sonic_lab_devices.csv): Helper file helps you create lab_connection_graph.xml, list all devices that are physically connected to fanout testbed (all devices should be in ansible/lab)

- [```ansible/files/sonic_lab_links.csv```](/ansible/files/sonic_lab_links.csv): Helper file helps you to create lab_connection_graph.xml, list all physical links between DUT, Fanoutleaf and Fanout root switches, servers and vlan configurations for each link

- [```ansible/files/sonic_lab_pdu_links.csv```](/ansible/files/sonic_lab_pdu_links.csv): Helper file helps you to create lab_connection_graph.xml, list all pdu links between devices and pdu devices. For details about pdu configuraions, check doc [pdu wiring](./README.testbed.PDUWiring.md)

- [```ansible/files/sonic_lab_bmc_links.csv```](/ansible/files/sonic_lab_bmc_links.csv): Helper file helps you to create lab_connection_graph.xml, list all bmc links between devices and management devices.

- [```ansible/files/sonic_lab_console_links.csv```](/ansible/files/sonic_lab_console_links.csv): Helper file helps you to create lab_connection_graph.xml, list all console links between devices and management devices.

- [```ansible/files/lab_connection_graph.xml```](/ansible/files/lab_connection_graph.xml): This is the lab graph file for library/conn_graph_facts.py to parse and get all lab fanout switch connections information. If you have only one fanout switch, you may go ahead and manually modify the sample lab_connection_graph.xml file to set both your fanout leaf and fanout root switch management IP point to the same fanout switch management IP and make sure all DUT and Fanout name and IP are matching your testbed.

- [```ansible/files/creategraph.py```](/ansible/files/creategraph.py): Helper file helps you generate a lab_connection_graph.xml based on the device file and link file specified above.

     Based on ansible_facts,  you may write ansible playbooks to deploy fanout switches or run test which requires to know the DUT physical connections to fanout switch


# Modify Testbed.yaml Configuration File
There are 7 main sections in testbed.yaml that need to be edited:
1. device_groups
2. devices
3. host_vars
4. veos_groups
5. veos
6. testbed
7. topology

Each of the sections above contribute to the files that need to be written into in order for the test cases to run. For more information about what each file does, please reference [Testbed Inventory](#testbed-inventory) and [Testbed Physical Topology](#testbed-physical-topology).

Within the testbed.yaml file:

### (OPTIONAL) testbed_config section:
- name - choose a name for this testbed config file
- alias - choose an alias for this testbed config file

### device_groups section
**USAGE**: lab

The device_groups section generates the lab file which is the inventory file necessary for setting up the testbed. While the format in the configuration file is in yaml format, the script converts it to INI format. The device groups section includes all lab DUTs, fanout switches, PTF containers, and testbed server topologies. Group children are referenced from the devices section below. For the most part this section can be left alone.

### devices section
**USAGE**: files/sonic_lab_devices, group_vars/fanout/secrets, group_vars/lab/secrets, lab

The devices section is a dictionary that contains all devices and hosts. This section does not contain information on PTF containers. For more information on PTF containers, see the testbed.yaml file.

For each device that you add, add the following:

| Hostname        | ansible_host | ansible_ssh_user | ansible_ssh_pass | HwSKU            | device_type |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| str-msn2700-01  | [IP Address] | [username]       | [password]       | DevSonic         | DevSonic    |
| str-7260-10     | [IP Address] | [username]       | [password]       | Arista-7260QX-64 | FanoutRoot  |
| str-7260-10     | [IP Address] | [username]       | [password]       | Arista-7260QX-64 | FanoutLeaf  |
| str-acs-serv-01 | [IP Address] | [username]       | [password]       | TestServ         | Server      |

- hostname - names the devices you will use
- ansible_host - this is the managementIP where you can connect to to the device
- ansible_ssh_user - this is your username to login to the device
- ansible_ssh_pass - this is your password to login to the device
- hwsku - this is the look up value for credentials in /group_vars/all/labinfo.json. Without this section, things will fail. Make sure this field is filled out and verify labinfo.json is accurate.
- device type - the type of device. If you only have 4 devices, you can leave the provided labels alone

The lab server section requires different fields to be entered: ansible_become_pass, sonicadmin_user, sonicadmin_password, sonicadmin_initial_password. Sonicadmin_user is still just the username. The other fields is the password. These fields were selected because they are variables taken directly group_var/lab/secrets.yml. For more information related to authentication, take a look at the [credentials section below](#credentials-management). So for convenience, this section of the config file takes a copy of the variable labels.

### host_vars section:
**USAGE**: all host_var values

Define the host variables here. In this guide, we define the lab server (str-acs-serv-01) here.

For each host device that you add; define or verify the:
- mgmt_bridge
- mgmt_prefixlen (this should match with the mgmt_subnet_mask_length)
- mgmt_gw
- external_port

### veos_groups section:
**USAGE**: veos

The veos_group section is an inventory section for all servers and VMs. Although this section cross references the veos section, it differs from the veos section because the veos section contains information about the VMs that will be used in the testbed environment.

For the most part, the group names can be left alone. However, you should verify the:
- VM IDs - if the VM IDs are changed in the Veos section, you must reflect those changes here under your vms group(s).
- host/ lab server - if you have defined the lab server as something other than str-acs-serv-01, you must reflect the change in the host_var_file variable under server_1's vars subsection. You must also reflect the change in the host subsection of vm_host_1

Variables and values in this section may fluctuate greatly depending on your testbed environment.

### veos section:
**USAGE**: group_vars/eos/creds, main.yml, group_vars/vm_host/creds

Like the veos_groups section, this section contains information about the servers and VMs within your testbed. There are two sets of tasks to perform.

Confirm the following:
- root_path - server's root path to building the VMs
- cd_image_filename - you should be able to locate "Aboot-veos-serial-8.0.0.iso"
- hdd_image_file: you should also be able to locate "vEOS-lab-4.20.15M.vmdk"

Define:
- vm_console_base - if you are running multiple sets of sonic-mgmt VMs, define a conflict-free vm_console_base
- ansible_user - username to access VM
- ansible_password - password to access VM
- ansible_sudo_pass - same as password above
- vms_1
    - define the VMs that you want to bring up (i.e.: VM0200, VM0201, VM0202, etc...)
    - define the IPs of the VMs (i.e." 10.250.1.0, 10.250.1.1, 10.250.1.2, etc...)

### testbed section:
**USAGE**: testbed.yaml

testbed.csv is deprecated, please use testbed.yaml instead.
This is where the topology configuration file for the testbed will collect information from when running TestbedProcessing.py.

```
- conf-name: vms-sn2700-t1
  group-name: vms1-1
  topo: t1
  ptf_image_name: docker-ptf
  ptf: ptf_vms1-1
  ptf_ip: 10.255.0.178/24
  ptf_ipv6: 2001:db8:1::3/64
  ptf_extra_mgmt_ip: []
  server: server_1
  vm_base: VM0100
  dut:
    - str-msn2700-01
  inv_name: lab
  auto_recover: 'True'
  comment: Tests Mellanox SN2700 vms
```

For each topology you use in your testbed environment, define the following:
- conf-name - to address row in table
- group-name - used in interface names, up to 8 characters. The variable can be anything but should be identifiable.
- topo - name of topology
- ptf_image_name - defines PTF image. In this guide, the docker-ptf was an image already on the local registry. However, there is a docker-ptf from the sonic-mgmt github that a user can pull from
    > git clone --recursive https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage.git <br/>
    > make configure PLATFORM=generic <br/>
    > make target/docker-ptf.gz
    > You can also download a pre-built docker-ptf image [here](https://sonic-build.azurewebsites.net/api/sonic/artifacts?branchName=master&platform=vs&buildId=42750&target=target%2Fdocker-ptf.gz)
- ptf - ptf container's name
- ptf_ip - ip address for mgmt interface of PTF container. Choose an IP address that is available
- ptf_ipv6 - ipv6 address for mgmt interface of PTF container. Choose an IPV6 address that is available
- server - server where the testbed resides. Choose a veos_group to use that contains both the lab server and virtual machines
- vm_base - enter in the lowest ID value for the VMs you will be using to run the test cases. The lowest VM ID value can be found under the veos section of the testbed configuration file. IF empty, no VMs are used
- dut - enter in the target DUT that is used in the testbed environment
- inv_name - inventory file name that contains the definition of the target DUTs
- auto_recover - (`yes`|`True`|`true`) to recover this testbed when runnings serve recovery script, (`no`|`False`|`false`) otherwise
- comment -  make a little note here
- ansible
    - ansible_host - IP address with port number
    - ansible_ssh_user - username to login to lab server
    - ansible_ssh_pass - password to login to lab server

#### Consistency Rule:
1. `conf-name` must be unique.
2. `group-name` must be up to 8 characters long.
3. All testbed with the same `group-name` must have the same:
      - `ptf_ip`
      - `server`
      - `vm_base`
4. `topo` name must be valid and presented in [`/ansible/vars/topo_*.yml`](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/tree/master/ansible/vars).
5. `ptf_image_name` must be valid.
6. `server` name must be valid and presented in [`veos`](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/ansible/veos) file.
7. `vm_base` must not overlap with testbed of different group names.

### topology section:
**USAGE**: files/sonic_lab_links.csv

This section of the testbed configuration file defines the connection between the DUT to the leaf-fanout and the leaf-fanout to the lab server.

**Static Values**: the bandwidth remains at 100000. VlanMode from the DUT to the leaf-fanout is always "Access." However, VlanMode from the leaf-fanout to the lab server is "Trunk".

From the DUT to the leaf-fanout, make sure to define:
- end ports - which DUT port is connected to which leaf-fanout (end) port
- vlanIDs - this is very important because the VlanIDs will bind to the ports

From the leaf-fanout to the server, make sure to define:
- lab device - the testbed server you will be using (probably str-acs-serv-01)
- endport - find this in ifconfig on your testbed server
- vlanID (range) - if you have 32 ports, the range is from the lowest VlanID you defined +31, totaling 32 ports

### docker_registry section:
**USAGE**: /vars/docker_registry.yml

The docker registry container below information:

1. docker_registry_host

If you already have this information set up, you can choose to leave this section blank and the script will skip this section.
If you are using local docker registry, you can add your docker_registry_host, docker_registry_username, and docker_registry_password into the file.
Example:
```
cat ~/sonig-mgmt/ansible/vars/docker_registry.yml
#docker_registry_host: sonicdev-microsoft.azurecr.io:443
docker_registry_host: 127.0.0.1:5000
docker_registry_username: root
docker_registry_password: root
```

### inventory file:

The inventory file contains all device host/IP information for testbeds within its inventory.
For example, the testbed `vms-sn2700-t1` uses the inventory file lab ( seecified by `inv_name: lab` in `testbed.yaml`).

The `ansible/lab` inventory file includes three types of section for different devices:
- sonic
- fanout/pdu/mgmt/server
- ptf

1. sonic Section

The sonic section lists various SONiC platforms, such as `sonic_sn2700_40`, `sonic_a7260`, etc.
Ensure that the following fields are correctly filled for your Device Under Test (DUT):

```
sonic_sn2700_40:
  vars:
    hwsku: ACS-MSN2700
    iface_speed: 40000
  hosts:
    str-msn2700-01:
      ansible_host: 10.251.0.188
      model: MSN2700-CS2FO
      serial: MT1234X56789
      base_mac: 24:8a:07:12:34:56
      syseeprom_info:
        "0x21": "MSN2700"
        "0x22": "MSN2700-CS2FO"
        "0x23": "MT1234X56789"
        "0x24": "24:8a:07:12:34:56"
        "0x25": "12/07/2016"
        "0x26": "0"
        "0x28": "x86_64-mlnx_x86-r0"
        "0x29": "2016.11-5.1.0008-9600"
        "0x2A": "128"
        "0x2B": "Mellanox"
        "0xFE": "0xFBA1E964"
```
- `iface_speed` is the speed of DUT's interface. For a 40G switch, `iface_speed` should be 40000; for a 100G switch, it should be 100000. The test `iface_namingmode/test_iface_namingmode.py` will fail if iface_speed is missing or incorrect.

- For the fields under `syseeprom_info`,  the EEPROM type descriptions are defined in `test_chassis.py` as follows:

```
# Valid OCP ONIE TlvInfo EEPROM type codes as defined here:
# https://opencomputeproject.github.io/onie/design-spec/hw_requirements.html
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_PRODUCT_NAME = '0x21'    # Product Name
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_PART_NUMBER = '0x22'     # Part Number
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_SERIAL_NUMBER = '0x23'   # Serial Number
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_BASE_MAC_ADDR = '0x24'   # Base MAC Address
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_MFR_DATE = '0x25'        # Manufacture Date
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_DEVICE_VERSION = '0x26'  # Device Version
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_LABEL_REVISION = '0x27'  # Label Revision
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_PLATFORM_NAME = '0x28'   # Platform Name
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_ONIE_VERSION = '0x29'    # ONIE Version
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_NUM_MACS = '0x2A'        # Number of MAC Addresses
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_MANUFACTURER = '0x2B'    # Manufacturer
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_COUNTRY_CODE = '0x2C'    # Country Code
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_VENDOR = '0x2D'          # Vendor
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_DIAG_VERSION = '0x2E'    # Diag Version
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_SERVICE_TAG = '0x2F'     # Service Tag
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_VENDOR_EXT = '0xFD'      # Vendor Extension
ONIE_TLVINFO_TYPE_CODE_CRC32 = '0xFE'           # CRC-32
```

- `show platform syseeprom` can get some of these values,
- The command `show platform syseeprom` can retrieve some of these values. The test case `tests/platform_tests/api/test_chassis.py` verifies the correctness of these fields. If some fields are unknown, running the test will show expected values for the unfilled fields, providing a summary of discrepancies. The summary looks like this:

```
Failed: 'base_mac' value is incorrect. Got '74:83:ef:63:e2:86', expected '74:83:ef:63:e2:87'
```

2. Fanout, PDU, Mgmt and Server Sections

Those record the hostname and IP address of the respective fanout switch, PDU, or console server.
Those devices are also recorded in the following csv files:

- `ansible/files/sonic_lab_devices.csv`
- `ansible/files/sonic_lab_pdu_links.csv`
- `ansible/files/sonic_lab_console_links.csv`

3. `ptf` Section

In `ptf` section the `ansible_ssh_user` and `ansible_ssh_pass` variables specify the credentials for the PTF container.
`ansible_host` should match the `ptf_ip` in `testbed.yaml`.

```
    ptf:
      vars:
        ansible_ssh_user: root
        ansible_ssh_pass: root
      hosts:
        ptf_ptf1:
          ansible_host: 10.255.0.188
          ansible_hostv6: 2001:db8:1::1/64
```

Ensure that these configurations are correct to facilitate proper communication and testing within the testbed environment.


# Credentials management

This section briefly describes how sonic-mgmt manages credentials for authentication purposes. `Pytest` will also use these variables to execute tests. 


Variables are stored in [`ansible/group_vars/<group_name>/*.(yml|json)`](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/tree/master/ansible/group_vars) where `<group_name>` is the name of the group declared in your inventory files. 

The default ansible group name `all` refers to all the groups. Therefore, we store the shared configs in `ansible/group_vars/all` folder.
For more information related to variable encryptions and how to use, please refer to [official Ansible variable documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html) and [official Ansible encryption and decryption guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault_encrypting_content.html#encrypting-individual-variables-with-ansible-vault).

Currently, the variables that we're using to authenticate are:

## Fanout

For explanations on how sonic-mgmt works with these variables, refer to [Fanout Credentials documentation](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/docs/testbed/README.testbed.Fanout.md).


### EOS (Arista)
- `fanout_admin_user`
- `fanout_admin_password`

### Melanox
- `fanout_mlnx_user`
- `fanout_mlnx_password`

### Sonic devices
- `fanout_sonic_user`
- `fanout_sonic_password`

### Tacas credentials
- `fanout_tacacs_user`
- `fanout_tacacs_password`

**Note:** when TACACS is enabled but different devices have different credentials, do not set `fanout_tacacs_user` and `fanout_tacacs_password` but do set `fanout_tacac_OS_user/password`, for example:
- `fanout_tacacs_mlnx_user`
- `fanout_tacacs_mlnx_password`
- `fanout_tacacs_eos_user`
- `fanout_tacacs_eos_password`
- `fanout_tacacs_sonic_user`
- `fanout_tacacs_sonic_password`

### Local credentials
These local credentials can be used in substitution of TACACS account. 

#### Network credential
- `fanout_network_user`
- `fanout_network_password`

#### Shell credential
- `fanout_shell_user`
- `fanout_shell_password`


## DUT credentails
- `sonicadmin_user`: os user for SONiC image
- `sonicadmin_password`: password for os user for SONiC image
- `sonicadmin_initial_password`: password you built into baseimage

- `eos_default_login`: default credential for Eos
- `eos_default_password`: default credential for Eos
- `eos_login`: credential for eos
- `eos_password`: credential for eos

- `junos_default_login`: default credential for Junos
- `junos_default_password`: default credential for Junos

- `junos_login`: credential for Junos
- `junos_password`: credential for Junos

- `cisco_login`: credential for Cisco
- `cisco_password`: credential for Cisco

- `sonic_login`: credential for SONiC
- `sonic_password`: credential for SONiC
- `sonic_default_passwords`: default password for SONiC

- `k8s_master_login`: credential for k8s
- `k8s_master_password`: credential for k8s

- `ptf_host_user`: credential for PTF
- `ptf_host_pass`: credential for PTF

- `vm_host_user`: credential for VM
- `vm_host_password`: credential for VM
- `vm_host_become_password`: root password for VM


# Testbed Processing Script
**NOTE**:
- This section is an example of starting VMs, deploying topology and running test cases with ansible-playbook. However, it is old-fasioned.
- For latest deploying, please refer [here](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/docs/testbed/README.testbed.Setup.md#setup-vms-on-the-server).
- For latest running test cases, please refer [here](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/docs/tests/README.md)

When the testbed.yaml file is completed with the values pertaining to your setup, place both the TestbedProcess.py script and the testbed.yaml configuration file into sonic-mgmt/ansible.

Run the TestbedProcessing.py script:
> python TestbedProcessing.py -i testbed.yaml
>
> Options: <br/>
> -i = the testbed.yaml file to parse <br/>
> -basedir = the basedir for the project <br/>
> -backup = the backup directory for the files

### VMS Commands
Start VMS (using vms_1):
> ./testbed-cli.sh start-vms vms_1 password.txt

Stop VMS (using vms_1):
> ./testbed-cli.sh stop-vms vms_1 password.txt

### Deploy (PTF32) Topology Container
In this guide, ptf32-1 will be added using the testbed-cli.sh script as an example. However, other topologies can be added as well.

Remove topology ptf32-1:
> ./testbed-cli.sh remove-topo ptf32-1 password.txt

Add topology ptf32-1:
> ./testbed-cli.sh add-topo ptf32-1 password.txt

You can check to see if it was removed or added using the "docker ps" or "docker container ls" command.

### Running the First Test Case (Neighbour)
When VMs and ptf32-1 topology is successfully added, the first test case, “neighbour” can be run. The testbed name and test case name need to be exported first. Check to see if they were exported properly. Afterwards, the playbook can be run.

Run the following commands:
> export TESTBED_NAME=ptf32-1 <br/>
> export TESTCASE_NAME=neighbour <br/>
> echo $TESTBED_NAME <br/>
> echo $TESTCASE_NAME <br/>
> ansible-playbook -i lab -l sonic-ag9032 test_sonic.yml -e testbed_name=$TESTBED_NAME -e testcase_name=$TESTCASE_NAME

### Additional steps before running QoS SAI Test Case

Unlike other SONiC test case, QoS SAI requires additional setup and syncd RPC container image building. Please refer [here](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/docs/testbed/README.testbed.QosRpc.md)

# Troubleshooting
Issue: Testbed Command Line complains there is no password file available. <br/>
Resolution: You can bypass this issue by creating an empty password file. CLI should be able to run afterwards.

Issue: The IPs I want to use are unavailable even after running the stop-vms command. <br />
Resolution: If you ran the stop-vms command and still face this issue, you can run the following:
> virsh <br/>
> list <br/>
> destroy VM_Name (delete the VM that is occupying the IP) <br/>
> exit (exit out of virsh)
However, make sure that no one else is using those IPs before permanently deleting the IPs


Issue: Task setup failure. SSH Error: data could not be sent to the remote host <br/>
Resolution: There are a plethora of things that could be wrong here. Here are some potential issues:
1. Make sure this host can be reached over SSH
2. Does your group_vars/all/lab_info.json file contain the correct credentials?
3. Does your device have the correct hwsku in files/sonic_lab_devices.csv?
4. Confirm that your lab file does not have "/"s after the IPs. "/"s are a way to denote port numbers which INI files do not recognize.
5. Recheck your testbed.yaml configuration file to see if you got the IPs and credentials correct


# Configuration Validation Script

We have provided a script that cross-checks your configuration with the guidelines outlined in this document to ensure optimal functionality. The script is located at `ansible/verify_config.py`.

To validate all configurations within your project, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 verify_config.py
```
The script will present any warnings or errors based on our validation rules, using the default testbed file `testbed.yaml` and the default VM file `veos`.


If you wish to use custom VM and testbed files, input the command as shown below, replacing <vm_file> and <testbed_file> with your filenames:

```bash
python3 verify_config.py -t <testbed-file> -m <vm-file>
```

For validating your connection to a specific testbed listed in the testbed file, run the following command **within `sonic-mgmt` container**:

```bash
python3 verify_config.py -tb <testbed-name>
```

Lastly, to specify both custom testbed and VM files along with a specific testbed, use:


```bash
