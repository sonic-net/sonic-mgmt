## About this Manual
This documentation provides general information about the Testbed V2 feature implementation for `sonic-mgmt`. Testbed V2 aims to support multi-DUTs deployment with dynamic VLAN assignment and inter-DUTs link state propagation. Based on the Redis Pub/Sub paradigm, the connection status changes(physical connections, virtual connections, VLAN assignments, etc) from test users into `connection_db` will signal the daemons over fanout switches about the key-space events to manipulate the physical devices/ports.

## Requirement Overview
* Maintain compatibility with existing testbed.
* Support testbed/topology with multiple DUTs that have inter-DUTs connections.
* Support flexible VLAN assignment.

## Components
* `test user`
* `connection_db`
  * Redis databases running on certain test server hosting connection-related metadata.
* `servercfgd`
  * running on the same server as `connection_db`.
  * a RPC server that is responsible for `connection_db` initial setup and provision.
* `labcfgd`
  * running on root/fanout switches
  * subscribe to keyspace events of `connection_db` and act accordingly.

## Database Schema
* `DB_CONNECTION_GRAPH_VERSIONS`
```
; ZSET that stores md5sum values of connection graph files that are used to provision `connection_db`

```
; List contains all the SONiC DUTs defined in the lab
key                              = DUT_LIST                                         ; contains DUT names that are FK to `SWITCH_TABLE`
```
* `SERVER_TABLE`
```
; Defines server metadata
key                              = SERVER_TABLE:server_name

* `PORT_LIST`
```
; List contains physical ports of either a root/leaf fanout switch, DUT or server 
key                              = PORT_LIST:<switch_name|dut_name|server_name>
```
* `PORT_TABLE`
```
; Defines port metadata

; field                          = value

* `VIRTLINK_TABLE`
```
; a virtual link between DUTs

## Implementation Plan
* The whole process is divided into three stages:
   1. stage#1: initial `connection_db` setup and provision
   2. stage#2: dynamic vlan assignment support
   3. stage#3: link state propagation support

### Stage#1
* In stage#1, we only cover initial `connection_db` setup and provision:
  1. Install Redis and its Python packages over selected test server.
  2. Run `servercfgd` over the selected test server.
  3. Provision the `connection_db` with the physical connections defined in the connection graph file.
* All the modules/plays to cover the functionalities list above will be included in Ansible role `connection_db`.
* Users are provided with a play `config_connection_db.yml` to call `connection_db` role to setup, provision or remove `connection_db`.

#### db setup
* Ensure Redis and py-redis packages are installed.
* Ensure Redis service is running.
* start `connection_db`.

#### db provision
* Provision the `connection_db` with the physical connections and static VLAN assignments defined in the connection graph file defined in [ansible/files](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt/tree/master/ansible/files).

#### changes to `conn_graph_files`
There will be an extra parameter added to `conn_graph_facts`: `conn_graph_facts_src`, it could be either `from_db`, which will retrieve the connection data from `connection_db`, or it could be `from_file` to get the data from parsing connection graph file like before. One thing to notice is that if `conn_graph_facts` fails with `conn_graph_facts_src=from_db`, it will fall back to `from_file`.
