# Transitioning Neighbor Devices to cSONiC in SONiC Testbed
This document outlines how to replace neighbor containers(cEOS, vEOS, vSONIC) in the SONiC community testbed with cSONiC containers, enabling a SONiC-to-SONiC test environment and the required design changes.

# Implementation Plan: Adding cSONiC Support in Testbed
To integrate cSONiC as a supported neighbor device in the SONiC testbed, several scripts and ansible roles must be updated to recognize and handle vm_type="csonic".

1. Update testbed-cli.sh.
Modify the CLI help text to include cSONiC as a valid VM type:

        echo "    -k <vmtype>     : vm type (veos|ceos|vsonic|vcisco|csonic) (default: 'ceos')"

   This ensures users can pass -k csonic when invoking the script.

2. Update testbed_add_vm_topology.yml. Add a new role entry for cSONiC in the roles section:

        roles:
         - { role: csonic, when: topology.VMs is defined and VM_targets is defined and inventory_hostname in VM_targets and (vm_type == "csonic") }`

3. Update roles/eos/tasks/main.yml. Add an include task for cSONiC similar to cEOS:

        - include_tasks: csonic.yml
          when: vm_type == "csonic"
4. Create roles/eos/tasks/csonic.yml
 
    This new task file will:
Include cSONiC-specific variables:

        - include_vars: group_vars/vm_host/csonic.yml
        - include_tasks: csonic_config.yml

5. Create roles/eos/tasks/csonic_config.yml

    Define configuration steps for cSONiC front panel and backplane ports.

6. Update ansible/group_vars/vm_host/main.yml
Add csonic to the list of supported VM types:
        
        supported_vm_types: [ "veos", "ceos", "vsonic", "vcisco", "csonic" ]
7. Create ansible/group_vars/vm_host/csonic.yml
Assign the cSONiC image file and URL:
        
        csonic_image_filename: docker-sonic-vs
        csonic_image: docker-sonic-vs
        csonic_image_url:
            - "http://example.com/docker-sonic-vs"
8. Modify roles/vm_set/tasks/add_topo.yml
Update cEOS network creation logic to also handle cSONiC:
        
        - include_tasks: add_cnet_list.yml
          when: vm_type is defined and (vm_type == "ceos" or vm_type == "csonic")
9. Create ansible/roles/vm_set/library/cnet_network.py
for creating container network interfaces (management, front-panel, backplane) for SONiC VMs and attaching them to host/OVS bridges.
This sets up connectivity between the testbed containers and the virtual network environment.

10. Create a file under ansible/roles/vm_set/tasks/add_cnet.yml for creating a base Debian container (net_*) with networking privileges to act as a network namespace.
Then we use a custom module (ceos_network / cnet_network) to attach cEOS or cSONiC containers to this network with management and front-panel interfaces.

11. Create ansible/roles/vm_set/tasks/add_cnet_list.yml. Here we are creating the VM network using the custom vm_topology module (setting up links/interfaces for all VMs).
Then we include add_cnet.yml to attach each VM from VM_targets to its corresponding container network â€” same can be done for cnet_list to loop through and add each cnet container.

# Testbed Setup
Follow the steps in this section to setup the testbed
    [Testbed Setup](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/docs/testbed/README.testbed.VsSetup.md#prepare-testbed-host)
## Deploying T0 Topology

Run the following commands to deploy the T0 topology:


        cd /data/sonic-mgmt/ansible
        ./testbed-cli.sh -t vtestbed.yaml -m veos_vtb -k csonic add-topo vms-kvm-t0 password.txt

## Download a VM image
We currently support EOS-based or SONiC VMs to simulate neighboring devices in the virtual testbed, much like we do for physical testbeds. To do so, we need to download the image to our testbed host.

Prepare folder for image files on testbed host

The location for storing image files on the testbed host is specified by the root_path variable in the ansible/group_vars/vm_host/main.yml file. Please update this variable to reflect the location you have planned for the testbed host. You can use either an absolute path or a relative path. If you choose a relative path, it will be relative to the home directory of the user accessing the testbed host.

For example, if root_path is set to veos-vm, the image location would be /home/$USER/veos-vm/images/. If root_path is set to /data/veos-vm, the image location would be /data/veos-vm/images.

As you may have noticed, image files are usually stored under subfolder images of location determined by root_path.

Example 1:

    root_path: veos-vm
Example 2:

    root_path: /data/veos-vm

## Prepare folder for image files on test server

Create a subfolder called images inside the root_path directory defined in ansible/group_vars/vm_host/main.yml file. For instance, if root_path is set to veos-vm, you should run the following command:

    mkdir -p ~/veos-vm/images
Prepare the cSONiC image file

Manually download cSONIC image
    
i. Obtain the csonic image

ii. Place the image file in the images subfolder located within the directory specified by the root_path variable in the ansible/group_vars/vm_host/main.yml file.

Assuming you set root_path to veos-vm, you should run the following command:

    cp docker-sonic-vs.gz ~/veos-vm/images/
The Ansible playbook for deploying testbed topology will automatically use the manually prepared image file from this location.

## Download sonic-vs image

## Setup Host Public Key

[Host Key Setup](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/docs/testbed/README.testbed.VsSetup.md#setup-host-public-key-in-sonic-mgmt-docker)


Verify that the cSONiC neighbors were created properly:

        $ docker ps


## Deploy minigraph on the DUT

Deploy the minigraph.xml to the DUT and save the configuration:
    
    ./testbed-cli.sh -t vtestbed.yaml -m veos_vtb deploy-mg vms-kvm-t0 veos_vtb password.txt

## Run a Pytest
Now that the testbed has been fully setup and configured, let's run a simple test to make sure everything is functioning as expected.

Switch over to the tests directory:
cd sonic-mgmt/tests
Run the following command to execute the bgp_fact test (including the pre/post setup steps):
If neighbor devices are cSONIC

    ./run_tests.sh -n vms-kvm-t0 -d vlab-01 -c bgp/test_bgp_fact.py -f vtestbed.yaml -i ../ansible/veos_vtb
