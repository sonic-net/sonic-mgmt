Test Case ID: 1
Test Case: VLAN Creation
Purpose: To verify that VLAN creation can be done via chef on SONiC based switch.
Steps/Procedure:
1. Upload the "sonic" cookbook (where VLAN resource is defined and the respective recipe and provider code is implemented) to the Chef server.
2. Also upload the "sonic.json" role where the VLAN config is mentioned.
3. Run the chef-client on the SONiC switch.
Expected Result:
VLAN as mentioned in the "sonic.json" role should be created successfully on the SONiC switch.
Observed Result:
Observed that VLAN as mentioned in the "sonic.json" role is created successfully on the SONiC switch.
Result: PASS
