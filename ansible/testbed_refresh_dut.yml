# This Playbook add refresh DUT in a topology
#
# Topologies are defined inside of vars/ directorie in files vars/topo_{{ topology_name}}.yml
# This file contains three structures:
#  - topology
#  - configuration property
#  - configuration
#
#  topology key contains a dictionary of hostnames with 'vm_offset' and 'vlans' keys in it.
#  'vm_offset' is used to map current hostname vm_set VM to server VM (like ARISTA01T0 -> VM0300).
#  This offset is used on VM_base
#  'vlans' is a list of vlan offsets which helps us to calculate vlan numbers which will be connected to Eth1/1..Eth1/8 interfaces.
#  These offsets are used with vlan_base
#
#  Every topology should have a name to distinct one topology from another on the server
#  Every topology contains a ptf container which will be used as placeholder for the injected interfaces from VMs, or direct connections to PTF host
#
# To add a topology please use following command
# ANSIBLE_SCP_IF_SSH=y ansible-playbook -i veos testbed_add_vm_topology.yml --vault-password-file=~/.password -l server_3 -e vm_set_name=first -e dut_name=str-msn2700-01 -e VM_base=VM0300 -e ptf_ip=10.255.0.255/23 -e topo=t0 -e ptf_imagename="docker_ptf"
#
# Parameters
# -l server_3                - this playbook have to be limited to run only on one server
# -e vm_set_name=first       - the name of vm_set
# -e dut_name=str-msn2700-01 - the name of target dut
# -e VM_base=VM0300          - the VM name which is used to as base to calculate VM name for this set
# -e ptf_ip=10.255.0.255/23 - the ip address and prefix of ptf container mgmt interface
# -e ptf_ipv6=fec0::ffff:afa:1/64 - the ipv6 address and prefix of ptf container mgmt interface
# -e topo=t0                 - the name of removed topo
# -e ptf_imagename=docker-ptf - name of a docker-image which will be used for the ptf docker container
