# Mux Simulator

In dualtor testbed, mux Y cable is simulated by OVS in test server. An OVS bridge is created for each of the mux. The PTF interface and test server VLAN interfaces are attached to the bridge. The VLAN interfaces are connected to DUT ports through fanout switches.

```
                          +--------------+
                          |              +----- upper_if
          PTF (host_if) --+  OVS bridge  |
                          |              +----- lower_if
                          +--------------+
```

Open flow rules are configured for the OVS bridge to simulate upstream broadcasting and downstream dropping traffic from standby side.

To further simulate mux Y cable active/standby querying and setting, a process need to be started in the test server. The process needs to expose APIs for querying and setting active/standby status. On DUT side, a plugin can be injected to intercept the calls to mux Y cable. Instead of calling the actual mux driver functions, the APIs of mux simulator are called. Then the process checks and updates open flow configurations of the OVS bridge accordingly

The mux_simulator.py script is for such purpose. It is a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) based program exposing HTTP API. While running `testbed-cli.sh add-topo`, it is deployed to test server and started as a systemd service.

On SONiC DUT side, xcvrd will firstly check configuration file `/etc/sonic/mux_simulator.json`. This configuration file contains information of reaching the mux simulator server. If the configuration file is found, xcvrd will try to load simulated y-cable driver based on information in it. If the configuration file is not found, xcvrd will try to read the actual cable's vendor/model information and load corresponding y-cable driver.

## Configuration

A test server may serve multiple dualtor testbeds. The original design is to start a single `mux-simulator` systemd service for all the dualtor testbeds using the server. It turns out that this approach is not flexible enough. Sometimes we may need to restart the mux-simulator server for one testbed. If the other testbeds are running tests, they could be negatively affected. The new design is to have a mux simulator service running for each testbed. Each of the mux simulator server listens on different TCP port. TCP port of mux simulator server for each dualtor testbed needs to be defined in file [https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/ansible/group_vars/all/mux_simulator_http_port_map.yml](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/ansible/group_vars/all/mux_simulator_http_port_map.yml). For example:
```
mux_simulator_http_port:
    # Format requirement:
    #   <testbed_name>: <port>

    # On server1
    dualtor-testbed-1: 8080
    dualtor-testbed-1: 8082

    # On server2
    dualtor-testbed-3: 8080
    dualtor-testbed-4: 8082

```
Please assign unused port for each testbed. On the same server, the ports must not be same for different testbeds.

The mux simulator would be deployed to test server as a systemd service `mux-simulator-<port>` during `testbed-cli.sh add-topo`.
```

Each testbed has its own mux simulator service. Name of the service is `mux-simulator-<port>`. Where `port` is the http port assigned to the mux simulator server of the testbed (`ansible/group_vars/all/mux_simulator_http_port_map`)

Example content of example mux-simulator-8080 service:

```
azure@test-server:~/veos-vm$ sudo cat /etc/systemd/system/mux-simulator-8080.service
[Unit]
Description=mux simulator
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env python /home/azure/veos-vm/mux_simulator.py 8080 vms6-1 -v
```

The parameter `vms6-1` after port `8080` in the above example is the vm_set name of the current testbed. It is value of column `group-name` in testbed.csv or value of field `group-name` in testbed.yml. When a dualtor testbed is deployed on test server, we use vm_set name in name of OVS bridges to differentiate multiple dualtor testbeds. That's why the vm_set name information is needed for mux simulator server for each testbed.

If the service file is changed, need to run below commands to restart it:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart mux-simulator-8080
```

## Shared by multiple test setups
Originally the mux-simulator service is shared by multiple dualtor test setups using the same test server. Now the design has changed. A mux simulator server is started on a different TCP port for each dualtor testbed now.

## How to troubleshoot mux simulator
By default, the mux-simulator service output its logs to `/tmp/mux_simulator.log`. Default debug level is INFO. If DEBUG level logging is needed for troubleshooting, please follow below steps:

1. Check mux simulator http port map, find out the port used by mux simulator of current testbed. Assume the assigned port is 8080. Then name of the mux simulator server service would be `mux-simulator-8080`.
```
cat ansible/group_vars/all/mux_simulator_http_port_map.yml
```
2. Stop the mux-simulator service.
```
sudo systemctl stop mux-simulator-8080
```
3. Find out path of the mux_simulator.py script from the mux-simulator systemd service file.
```
cat /etc/systemd/system/mux-simulator-8080.service
```
4. Manually run the mux_simulator.py script with `-v` option to **turn on DEBUG level logging**.
```
 sudo /usr/bin/env python /home/azure/veos-vm/mux_simulator.py 8080 vms6-1 -v
```
5. Try to call the mux simulator HTTP APIs and check the log file `/tmp/mux_simulator_8080.log` for detailed logging.
6. After troubleshooting is done, stop the manually started mux_simulator.py script (for example: Ctrl+C).
7. Start the mux-simulator service again.
```
sudo systemctl start mux-simulator-8080
```
