# --- Part of lagall.yml test ---
#---------------------------------------------------------
# This test verifies that the LACP rate is the same on DUT and VMs.
#
# The following actions are to be done for each VM:
#   1) Perform show running-config on VM.
#   2) Parse the result by bash commands and read LACP rate.
#   3) Verify if it's slow and raise an error in another case.
#
# @ params: login_creds     -   credentials for Arista VM

# @ params: lag_member_1      -    Second LAG member on VM
# @ params: vm_ip             -    Taken from lag_link_flap_vars.yml
