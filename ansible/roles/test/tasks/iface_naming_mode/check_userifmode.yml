#When the interface naming mode is set,it is written as environment variable in bashrc file.
#The device need to be logout and login for the actual environment variable to take effect.
# As the ansible work in non interactive mode, it doesnt read the environmental varaiable set in bashrc file. Hence as a workaround  the variable is  extracted through check_userifmode.yml and manually set the variable 'SONIC_CLI_IFACE_MODE' to take effect.


- name:  Extract the "SONIC_CLI_IFACE_MODE" value from bashrc file
  shell: "cat /home/{{uname1}}/.bashrc | grep SONIC_CLI_IFACE_MODE"
  args:
     executable: /bin/bash
  register: envout

#extract the environmental variable and save it in the variable 'ifmode_env'
- set_fact:
    ifmode_env: "{{envout.stdout}}"
- set_fact: ifmode="{{ifmode_env.split('=')[1]}}"

- debug: msg="Interface mode is set to '{{ifmode}}'"

- command: show interfaces naming_mode
  register: naming_mode
  environment:
    SONIC_CLI_IFACE_MODE: "{{ifmode}}"

- name: check the interface mode is properly set to {{mode}}
