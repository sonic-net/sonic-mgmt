# As the ansible work in non interactive mode, it doesnt read the environmental varaiable set in bashrc file. Hence as a workaround, the variable is  extracted through check_userifmode.yml and manually set the variable 'SONIC_CLI_IFACE_MODE' to take effect.

  environment:
      SONIC_CLI_IFACE_MODE: "{{ifmode}}"
