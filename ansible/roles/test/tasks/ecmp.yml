# This is ecmp test. In this test, all DUT's neighbor interfaces are
# shutdown. After each shutdown, the DUT's interface is verified to see if it
# is updated to the correct up/down state. In addition, a prefix is verified
# for the removed/added ECMP path. Convergence time is calculated after shutting
# down each interface.
