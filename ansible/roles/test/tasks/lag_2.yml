### this is the Lag_2 lag test that tests each Lag interface minimum link and rate of sending LACP DU packets
### this test could be consider as an additional/alternative lag test from existing lagall.yml.
### Due to some labs are using two layer fanout switches, and one DUT might connects to multiple fanoutleaf switches
### so for minimum link test of lag member flaps, it requires to use lab connection facts to determine the fanout neighbor ports,
### Also, most of the traffic load balancing tests of LAG interface are covered in new FIB tests. so we are ignoring traffic test
### for lag member flaps for now, will consider add traffic back if required
