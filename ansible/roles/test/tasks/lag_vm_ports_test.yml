# Shutdown each LAG member on VMs.
#
# The following actions are to be done for each LAG (and each VM):
#   1.1) Put DOWN EOS interface on VM (simulation of the halt of sending LACP packets).
#   1.2) Verify all the traffic goes through another LAG member and no packets lost.
#
# @ params: login_creds     -   credentials for Arista VM
# @ params: vm_name
# @ params: lag_ip          -   LAG interface IP address
# @ params: lag_member_0    -   First LAG member on VM
# @ params: lag_member_1    -   Second LAG member on VM
# @ params: iface_behind_lag_member_0   -   PTF docker iface, connected to LAG VM
# @ params: iface_behind_lag_member_1   -   PTF docker iface, connected to LAG VM
# @ params: not_behind_lag_iface        -   PTF docker interface that is connected to non-LAG VM (meaning eth31)
# @ params: vm_ip       -    VM mgmt IP; taken from lag_link_flap_vars.yml
# @ params: num_of_pkts -    number of packets to send while PTF test.
