# KVM Testbed Setup
This document describes the steps to setup a virtual switch based testbed, deploy a T0 topology to it, and run a quick test to verify it is working as expected.

## Prepare testbed host
First, we need to prepare the host where we will be configuring the virtual testbed and running the tests.

1. Install Ubuntu 20.04 AMD64 on your host or VM
    - To setup a T0 topology, the server needs to have at least 10GB of memory free
    - If the testbed host is a VM, then it must support nested virtualization
        - [Instructions for Hyper-V based VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization#configure-nested-virtualization)

2. Run the host setup script to install required packages and initialize the management bridge network

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt
cd sonic-mgmt/ansible
sudo ./setup-management-network.sh
```

3. [Install Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/). Be sure to follow the [post-install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) so that you don't need sudo privileges to run docker commands.

## Download an EOS VM image
We currently use EOS-based VMs to simulate neighboring devices in the virtual testbed, much like we do for physical testbeds. To do so, we need to download the image to our testbed host.

### Option 1: vEOS (KVM-based) image
1. Download the [vEOS image from Arista](https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download)
2. Copy below image files to `~/veos-vm/images` on your testbed host:
   - `Aboot-veos-serial-8.0.0.iso`
   - `vEOS-lab-4.20.15M.vmdk`

### Option 2: cEOS (container-based) image (experimental)
#### Option 2.1: Download and import cEOS image manually
1. Download the [cEOS image from Arista](https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download)
2. Import the cEOS image (it will take several minutes to import, so please be patient!)

```
$ docker import cEOS64-lab-4.23.2F.tar.xz ceosimage:4.23.2F
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                     TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ceosimage                                      4.23.2F             d53c28e38448        2 hours ago         1.82GB
```

#### Option 2.2: Pull cEOS image automatically
1. Alternatively, you can host the cEOS image on a http server. Specify `vm_images_url` for downloading the image [here](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/ansible/group_vars/vm_host/main.yml#L2).

2. If a SAS key is required for downloading the cEOS image, specify `ceosimage_saskey` in `sonic-mgmt/ansible/vars/azure_storage.yml`.

If you want to skip downloading the image when the cEOS image is not imported locally, set `skip_ceos_image_downloading` to `true` in `sonic-mgmt/ansible/group_vars/all/ceos.yml`. Then, when the cEOS image is not locally available, the scripts will not try to download it and will fail with an error message. Please use option 1 to download and import the cEOS image manually.

## Download the sonic-vs image
To run the tests with a virtual SONiC device, we need a virtual SONiC image. The simplest way to do so is to download a public build from Jenkins.

1. Download the sonic-vs image from [here](https://sonic-jenkins.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/job/vs/job/buildimage-vs-image/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/sonic-vs.img.gz)

```
$ wget https://sonic-jenkins.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com/job/vs/job/buildimage-vs-image/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/sonic-vs.img.gz
```

2. Unzip the image and move it into `~/sonic-vm/images/`

```
$ gzip -d sonic-vs.img.gz
$ mkdir -p ~/sonic-vm/images
$ mv sonic-vs.img ~/sonic-vm/images
```

## Setup sonic-mgmt docker
All testbed configuration steps and tests are run from a `sonic-mgmt` docker container. This container has all the necessary packages and tools for SONiC testing so that test behavior is consistent between different developers and lab setups.

1. Run the `setup-container.sh` in the root directory of the sonic-mgmt repository:

```
$ cd sonic-mgmt
$ ./setup-container.sh -n <container name> -d /data
```

2. From now on, **all steps are running inside the sonic-mgmt docker**, unless otherwise specified.


You can enter your sonic-mgmt container with the following command:

```
$ docker exec -it <container name> bash
```

You will find your sonic-mgmt directory mounted at `/data/sonic-mgmt`:

```
$ ls /data/sonic-mgmt/
LICENSE  README.md  __pycache__  ansible  docs	lgtm.yml  setup-container.sh  spytest  test_reporting  tests
```

## Setup host public key in sonic-mgmt docker
In order to configure the testbed on your host automatically, Ansible needs to be able to SSH into it without a password prompt. The `setup-container` script from the previous step will setup all the necessary SSH keys for you, but there are a few more modifications needed to make Ansible work:

1. Modify `veos_vtb` to use the user name (e.g. `foo`) you want to use to login to the host machine (this can be your username on the host)

```
foo@sonic:/data/sonic-mgmt/ansible$ git diff
diff --git a/ansible/veos_vtb b/ansible/veos_vtb
index 3e7b3c4e..edabfc40 100644
--- a/ansible/veos_vtb

@@ -73,7 +73,7 @@ vm_host_1:

-      ansible_user: use_own_value
+      ansible_user: foo

 vms_1:
   hosts:
```

2.  Create a dummy `password.txt` file under `/data/sonic-mgmt/ansible`
    - **Note**: Here, `password.txt` is the Ansible Vault password file. Ansible allows users to use Ansible Vault to encrypt password files.
    
      By default, the testbed scripts require a password file. If you are not using Ansible Vault, you can create a file with a dummy password (e.g. `abc`) and pass the filename to the command line. The file name and location is created and maintained by the user.

3. **On the host,** run `sudo visudo` and add the following line at the end:

```
foo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

4. Verify that you can login into the host (e.g. `ssh foo@172.17.0.1`) from the `sonic-mgmt` container without any password prompt.

5. Verify that you can use `sudo` without a password prompt inside the host (e.g. `sudo bash`).

## Setup Arista VMs on the server
**(Skip this step if you are using cEOS - the containers will be automatically setup in a later step.)**

Now we need to spin up some VMs on the host to act as neighboring devices to our virtual SONiC switch.

1. Start the VMs:
```
$ ./testbed-cli.sh -m veos_vtb -n 4 start-vms server_1 password.txt
```

- **Reminder:** By default, this shell script requires a password file. If you are not using Ansible Vault, just create a file with a dummy password and pass the filename to the command line.


2. Check that all VMs are up and running. **Note:** The passwd is `123456`.
```
$ ansible -m ping -i veos_vtb server_1 -u root -k
VM0102 | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
                "ping": "pong"
}

                "ping": "pong"
}

                "ping": "pong"
}
VM0103 | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
                "ping": "pong"
}
VM0100 | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
                "ping": "pong"
}
```


## Deploy T0 topology
Now we're finally ready to deploy the topology for our testbed! Run the following command, depending on what type of EOS image you are using for your setup:

### vEOS
```
$ cd /data/sonic-mgmt/ansible
$ ./testbed-cli.sh -t vtestbed.csv -m veos_vtb add-topo vms-kvm-t0 password.txt
```

### cEOS
```
$ cd /data/sonic-mgmt/ansible
$ ./testbed-cli.sh -t vtestbed.csv -m veos_vtb -k ceos add-topo vms-kvm-t0 password.txt
```

Verify that the cEOS neighbors were created properly:

```
$ docker ps

```

## Deploy minigraph on the DUT
Once the topology has been created, we need to give the DUT an initial configuration.

1. Deploy the `minigraph.xml` to the DUT and save the configuration:

```
$ ./testbed-cli.sh -t vtestbed.csv -m veos_vtb deploy-mg vms-kvm-t0 lab password.txt
```

2. Verify that you can login to the SONiC KVM using Mgmt IP = 10.250.0.101 and admin:password.

3. You should see BGP sessions up in SONiC:

```
admin@vlab-01:~$ show ip bgp sum
BGP router identifier 10.1.0.32, local AS number 65100
RIB entries 12807, using 1401 KiB of memory
Peers 8, using 36 KiB of memory
Peer groups 2, using 112 bytes of memory

10.0.0.61       4 64600    3205     950        0    0    0 00:00:21     1
10.0.0.63       4 64600    3204     950        0    0    0 00:00:21     1
```

## Run a Pytest
Now that the testbed has been fully setup and configured, let's run a simple test to make sure everything is functioning as expected.

1. Switch over to the `tests` directory:

```
cd sonic-mgmt/tests
```

2. Run the following command to execute the `bgp_fact` test (including the pre/post setup steps):

```
./run_tests.sh -n vms-kvm-t0 -d vlab01 -c bgp/test_bgp_fact.py -f vtestbed.csv -i veos_vtb
```

You should see three sets of tests run and pass. You're now set up and ready to use the KVM testbed!
