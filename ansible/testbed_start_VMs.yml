# This Playbook deploys all VMs defined in an inventory file under vms_x
# 
# We need to run this playbook first, before we run any testbed_add script
#
# Every VM has 10 interfaces:
#  - mgmt interface which is connected to the routable physical network. This address is defined as ansible_host in veos playbook   
#  - Eth1/1 - Eth1/8 is connected to an ovs-bridge and later it could bound by testbed_add_vm_topology.yml
#  - Eth1/9 is connected to other vm_set VMs Eth1/9
#
# To start all vm_sets on all servers:
# ANSIBLE_SCP_IF_SSH=y ansible-playbook -i veos testbed_start_VMs.yml --vault-password-file=~/.password
#
# To run on the first server only:
# ANSIBLE_SCP_IF_SSH=y ansible-playbook -i veos testbed_start_VMs.yml --vault-password-file=~/.password -l server_1
