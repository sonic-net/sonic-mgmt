# Inject mux simulator config
# Below step is required after these PRs are merged:
# * https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-platform-common/pull/213
# * https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-platform-daemons/pull/197
# For the simulated y_cable driver to work, basic configuration information of the mux simulator is required.
# When /etc/sonic/mux_simulator.json file is found on DUT, xcvrd will try to load simulated y_cable driver.
# Otherwise, xcvrd will try to get cable vendor and model, then load corresponding y_cable driver based on
# actual vendor/model of connected cable.
