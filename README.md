### GitHub Workflow

We're following basic GitHub Flow. If you have no idea what we're talking about, check out [GitHub's official guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Note that merge is only performed by the repository maintainer.

Guide for performing commits:

* Isolate each commit to one component/bugfix/issue/feature
* Use a standard commit message format:

>     [component/folder touched]: Description intent of your changes
> 
>     [List of changes]
>     
> 	  Signed-off-by: Your Name your@email.com
    
For example:

>     swss-common: Stabilize the ConsumerTable
>     
>     * Fixing autoreconf
>     * Fixing unit-tests by adding checkers and initialize the DB before start
>     * Adding the ability to select from multiple channels
>     * Health-Monitor - The idea of the patch is that if something went wrong with the notification channel, 
>       we will have the option to know about it (Query the LLEN table length).
>       
>       Signed-off-by: user@dev.null
