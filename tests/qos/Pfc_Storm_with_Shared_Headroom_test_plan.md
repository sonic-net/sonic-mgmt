# PFC Storm with Shared Headroom Test Plan

# Motivation

This test covers the scenrio when a PFC Watchdog is applied on a port which already has it's occupancy crossed into shared headroom.

The test checks if any PFC Frames are sent to the peer link from the DUT port.

**Note: **
+ This test case is only intended for Mellanox Platforms
+ This test case requires an RPC image
+ Shared Headroom has to be enabled on the device.

# Test Plan
+ Verify if the shared headroom is enabled
+ Make sure buffer occupancy crosses into the shared headroom region
# L624.
- Achieve buffer congestion by closing the dut tx port using `sai_thrift_port_tx_disable` API: https: // github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/tests/saitests/switch.py
- Send pkts from the PTF docker which are destined to egress out of the dut tx port.
- Make sure to send atleast num_pkts_pfs_frame + private_headroom pkts pkts
- num_pkts_pfs_frame: num of pkts required to be sent in order to trigger a PFC frame from the DUT. More on this here: https: // github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/tests/qos/files/mellanox/qos_param_generator.py
- private_headroom_pkts is specific to mellanox which is in the order of a few pkts.
- To check if the occupancy has indeed crossed into the shared headroom, use the SAI_INGRESS_PRIORITY_GROUP_STAT_XOFF_ROOM_WATERMARK_BYTES value. This can be fetched using "show priority-group watermark headroom" command.

+ The test triggers a PFC storm on the DUT port
+ PFC Watchdog is triggered
+ The test will stop the PFC Storm and once the PFC WD is restored, the Ingress buffers will be drained to drop the occupancy under Xon
- Achieve this by re-opening dut tx port using `sai_thrift_port_tx_enable` API.
- This'll drain the buffers and the occupancy falls below Xon.
+ Check the Tx PFC Counters on the DUT source port which was stormed after the packets are drained. They shouldn't be incremented as the occupancy has fallen below Xon
