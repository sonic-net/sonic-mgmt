ACTIVE:
Uplink->Downlink: OK
Downlink->Uplink: Packet not received <--- need to use VLAN MAC instead of router MAC on dualtor for downlinks

STANDBY:
Uplink->Downlink: Packet not received <--- G A R P
Downlink->Uplink: Packet received on a Downlink <--- need to use VLAN MAC instead of router MAC on dualtor for downlinks
(the drop tests will start failing b/c the active tor will not have any ACL rules, so we need to apply the config to both)
