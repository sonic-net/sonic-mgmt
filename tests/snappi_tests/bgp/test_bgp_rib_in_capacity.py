    Topo:
    TGEN1 --- DUT --- TGEN(2..N)

    Steps:
    1) Create a BGP config on DUT and TGEN respectively
    2) Create a flow from TGEN1 to TGEN2 port
    3) Send Traffic from TGEN1 to TGEN2 port route range
    4) Check if there is any loss observed
    5) Increment the routes in terms of step_value and repeat test untill loss is observed
    6) Note down the number of routes upto which no loss was observed which is the RIB-IN capacity value
    7) Clean up the BGP config on the dut
    Note:
        confihgure DUT interfaces prior to running test
    Verification:
    1) Send traffic and make sure there is no loss observed
    2) If loss is observed quit the test and note down the maximum routes upto which there was no loss
