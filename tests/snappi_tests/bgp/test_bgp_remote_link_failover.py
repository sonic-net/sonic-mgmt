    Topo:
    TGEN1 --- DUT --- TGEN(2..N)

    Steps:
    1) Create BGP config on DUT and TGEN respectively
    2) Create a flow from TGEN1 to (N-1) TGEN ports
    3) Send Traffic from TGEN1 to (N-1) TGEN ports having the same route range
    4) Simulate route withdraw from one of the (N-1) BGP peers which is the equivalent of remote link failure
    5) Calculate the cp/dp for convergence time
    6) Clean up the BGP config on the dut

    Verification:
    1) Send traffic with all routes advertised by BGP peers
        Result: Should not observe traffic loss
    2) Withdraw all routes from one of the BGP peer
        Result: The traffic must be routed via rest of the ECMP paths and should not observe traffic loss
