    Steps:
    1) Create 2 servers and a T1 device with dual stack BGP
    2) Configure LAG for the T1 Device
    3) Send Traffic from Server1 to Server2, server2 to Server1,
       T1 to Server1, T1 to server2, Server1 to T1 and Server2 to T1
    4) Make sure there is no loss observed while sending trafic
    5) Reboot the dut with fast-reboot command
    6) Make sure after reboot the traffic has converged
    Verification:
    1) Make sure the control plane is up after the reboot is complete
       and the dut is back up
    2) Traffic must have converged after the dut is back up
