qos/test_pfc_pause.py::test_pfc_pause_lossless:
  # For this test, we use the fanout connected to the DUT to send PFC pause frames.
  # The fanout needs to send PFC frames fast enough so that the queue remains completely paused for the entire duration
  # of the test. The inter packet interval between PFC frames to completely block a queue vary based on link speed and
  # we have seen flakiness in our test runs. Since this test is already covered under the 'ixia' folder where we use a
  # traffic generator to generate pause frames, skipping this here.
