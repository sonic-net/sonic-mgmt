# In this file should be defined regular expressions to match specific device platform which has combined:

# Platform name can be obtained by calling CLI command: show platform summary
#
# Example:
# root@sonic:/home/admin# show platform summary
# Platform: x86_64-mlnx_msn2740-r0
# HwSKU: ACS-MSN2740
# ASIC: mellanox
