# Overview
The goal is to test the events system from publishing end point to external receiving end point that tests every supported event which includes validation against the schema.

# Scope
This system is platform independent. This can be run on a fully configured & functioning SONiC system. As this involves BGP & Interface startup shutdown, require system with established BGP sessions.

# Test bed
Any testbed with couple of established BGP sessions.

# Setup configuration
Require: Few established BGP sessions and all *expected* dockers running.

# Test
This test will simulate scenarios to get the event fired and verify the fired event. It would also test cacheing, timeout, heartbeat & stats.

# Test - Event receiver tool
To test end to end, we need a tool that receives via gNMI

1) Build a gNMI client tool (Go is easier) as part of SONiC-gNMI.
2) Let the tool take arguments as with default values for all.
   * list of keys of interest (key = < Yang nodule >:< Yang container >"); default: any/all
   * Count of events to receive. default: Receive until SIGHUP signal
   * o/p file to receive the events; default: No events written
   * receive timeout -- default: no timeout
   * Use cache -- default: false
   * heartbeat duration -- default: no heartbeat
   * Explicit pause between two receive calls; default = 0

3) Tool writes received event as list pf JSON entries.
   [</br>
      {</br>
         "event_str": < .. .>,</br>
         "missed": <cnt></br>
         "timestamp": < timestamp ></br>
      },</br>
      ...</br>
   ]</br>
4) Tools spew total count of received events into STDOUT, during exit.

5) The tool exits upon any of the following:
   * Failed to receive/subscribe. This includes receive timeout.
   * Any other internal failure.
   * Received expected count of events
   * Received SIGHUP signal.

5) This tool can be copied into host from telemetry docker.

# Test cases
## For events that can be simulated
For each event</br>
   * A function is written to simulate the event and as well revert the simulation.
   * For certain events, might need to run some commands from connected switches -- e.g. BGP Notifications
   * For certain events, which may happen periodically, simulation may just simply pause for required time.
   * Write the list of expected events in the same format as event-receiver tool's JSON list'
   * Verify the content of each event in expected list against the schema in /usr/local/yang-events
   * Run the receive tool with expected keys, receive-count and o/p file.
   * Pause a second to ensure the client has established subscriber connection.
   * Kick off simulation; Pause a second or more depending on how long the simulation take to result in event publish.
   * Event publish API itself would take about 100ms to reliably reach the receiver.
   * Expect receiver tool to exit; If not, stop the receiver via SIGHUP.
   * Open the received o/p as JSON object, which should be a JSON list.
   * Compare the list against the expected.

## For kernel events that can *NOT* be simulated
   e.g. "kernel.*write failed"
1) Scan kernel code in open source for expected log strings.
    * List the versions of scanned kernels in the test code.
    * At run time verify current version against this list.
    * Fail if this version is not listed. Suggest steps to validate & fix by adding the version to the list.

2) Using logger to write logs as kernel would do and verify fired event
   Use steps above to capture & analyze the event.

## Events storming.
1) Stop all containers except eventd, database & telemetry and monit to get the max CPU power
2) Have a receiver tool running for all events with no count limit and no o/p file (as file write might throttle).
3) Write a publish tool that can use N threads and each M publish events to get the max rate of 100K events/second for 5 seconds. M & N needs to be assessed.
4) Pause for 3 seconds for async draining to complete.
5) Stop the tool via SIGHUP
6) Verify the receiver tool's o/p on count.
7) Check stats on
   * events-published
   * verify the rest of the counters to be 0

## Events caching
1) Create expected o/p file of events with N events (say N = 20) in the same format as our receiver tool.
2) To get controlled atmosphere, stop all containers except eventd, database & telemetry and monit
3) Restart eventd to get clean state. Pause for a second for service stabilization.
4) Call events-publisher tool or directly via events API to publish M events (M < N).
5) Start the receiver tool with use-cache set to true.
6) Publish the remainder of events (N-M)
7) Verify the o/p file against expected.
8) Check stats on
   * events-published == N
   * verify the rest of the counter to be 0

### Events caching overflow
1) Repeat the above with variations as below.
   * Use a single event to publish repeatedly.
   * Set M = <Max cache size> + 10.
   * Add a pause of 10ms between two publish to *ensure* that indeed every event is received and any drop is done by eventd *only*.
2) Start the receiver tool with a receive-timeout and no o/p file. The file writing could become a blocker, otherwise.
4) Wait for tool to exit via receive timeout.
5) If tool would not exit after N seconds (need to assess N), send SIGHUP to receiver.
6) Check the receiver tool o/p to be M'
7) Check stats on
   * events-published == M+10
   * missed_to_cache = 10
   * verify the rest of the counter to be 0

## Heartbeat
1) Start receiver tool to with heartbeat duration set to 1 sec and set it to receive only heartbeat events into a o/p file
2) Sleep for N+2 seconds
3) Send SIGHUP to stop the tool
4) Expect N heartbeat events in o/p file.

## Events dropped on slow receiver
1) Start receiver with 60 seconds pause between to receices; use no cache and no o/p file either with no count set for receive.
2) To get controlled atmosphere, stop all containers except eventd, database & telemetry and monit.
3) Stop eventd & telemetry; clear stats for events; start both; Pause a second for stabilization.
3) Publish N messages where N > (TELEMETRY's max Q size * 2)
4) Pause an second to ensure telemetry could receive all.
5) Stop receiver via SIGHUP.
6) Verify stats to have non-zero value for missed_by_slow_receiver


## events latency  - Experimental
1) To get controlled atmosphere, stop all containers except eventd, database & telemetry and monit.
2) Stop eventd & telemetry; clear stats for events; start both; Pause a second for stabilization.
3) Run receiver with count as 5 events with no receive timeout.
3) Publish 2 events.
4) Send SIGSTOP to eventd process
5) Publish 3 more events
6) Pause a second
7) Send SIGCONT to eventd process.
8) Wait for revceiver to exit; To handle error case, set a max timeout of 1 second.
9) Expect receiver to receive all 5.
10) Expect non zero value for latency_in_ms.
