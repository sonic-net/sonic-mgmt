# Setup Instructions

Run the script `setup_environment.sh` to install the required packages for testing and committing changes to tests/common2. This installs the required software and pre-commit hooks that are used to validate commits made to tests/common2 directory. It is recommended to have a python virtual environment and run the script in the virutal environment.
