class TestAutostateDisabled:
    """
    This test case is used to verify that vlan interface autostate is **disabled** on SONiC.

    The autostate feature notifies a switch or routing module VLAN interface (Layer 3 interface) to transition to
    up/up status when at least one Layer 2 port becomes active in that VLAN.

    In SONiC, all vlans are bound to a single bridge interface, so the vlan interface will go down only if the bridge
    is down. Since bridge goes down when all the associated interfaces are down, if all the vlan members across all
    the vlans go down, the bridge will go down and the vlan interface will go down.

    For more information about autostate, see:
      * https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/41141-188.html
